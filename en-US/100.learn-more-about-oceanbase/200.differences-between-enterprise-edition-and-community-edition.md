# Differences between the features of the Enterprise Edition and the Community Edition

OceanBase Database is available in two forms: OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition and OceanBase Database Community Edition.

* OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition is a native distributed database for enterprises. It implements financial-grade high availability based on regular hardware. Its ground-breaking deployment mode of five IDCs across three regions creates a new standard for automatic lossless disaster recovery at the region level. It has set new records in  the TPC-C benchmark. It supports more than 1,500 nodes in one cluster. It is cloud-native, highly consistent, and highly compatible with Oracle/MySQL.

* OceanBase Database Community Edition is a standalone distributed and integrated database compatible with MySQL. It is built on the native distributed architecture and supports enterprise-level features such as financial-grade high availability, transparent horizontal scaling, distributed transactions, multitenancy, and syntax compatibility. OceanBase Database Community Edition is an open-source database management system that is compatible with MySQL, can connect to virtualization and big data applications and products, and supports various GUI-based development tools, O&M and monitoring tools, and data migration tools. OceanBase Database Community Edition also provides open APIs and various eco-capabilities to meet the business requirements of enterprises or individuals.
