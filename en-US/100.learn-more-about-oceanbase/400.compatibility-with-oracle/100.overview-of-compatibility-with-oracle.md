# Overview

This topic describes the compatibility between OceanBase Database in Oracle mode and native Oracle Database.

OceanBase Database is compatible with Oracle Database in terms of basic features such as data types, SQL functions, and database objects. In addition, OceanBase Database supports all procedural language (PL)-related R&D features of Oracle Database. In terms of advanced features such as database security, backup and restore, high availability, and optimizer, OceanBase Database not only provides sound compatibility with Oracle Database but even outperforms it in some cases. This means that you can smoothly migrate your data and services from Oracle Database to OceanBase Database without having to spend a lot of time learning everything about OceanBase Database.

However, due to the differences in underlying architecture and product form, OceanBase Database does not support some features of Oracle Database and may differ from it in some aspects. This topic will cover the following aspects of compatibility between OceanBase Database and Oracle Database:

* SQL data types

* Built-in functions

* SQL syntax

* Procedural languages

* System views

* Character sets and collations

* Database object management

* Security features

* Backup and restore

* SQL engine

* Unsupported features

## SQL data types

Oracle Database supports 24 data types and OceanBase Database supports 20 of them. For more information, see [SQL data types](../400.compatibility-with-oracle/200.sql-data-type.md). However, for optimization purposes, OceanBase Database has no plans to support the `LONG` and `LONG RAW` data types, as they are considered outdated.



  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The large object (LOB) data types in OceanBase Database have a size limit of 48 MB and may not perform well in complex scenarios. Therefore, we recommend that you do not use them in such cases. For more information, see <a href="../../700.reference/400.development-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/300.basic-elements-of-oracle-mode/100.built-in-data-types-of-oracle-mode/600.large-object-data-type-of-oracle-mode/100.data-types-of-large-objects-of-oracle-mode.md">LOB data types</a>. </p>
  </main>

## Built-in functions

OceanBase Database supports most of the SQL syntax in Oracle Database.

For some syntax, OceanBase Database will return an "unsupported syntax" error because the corresponding features are unavailable.

* The following set operators are supported: `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `MINUS`.

* The following syntax is supported for viewing execution plans:

   ```sql
   EXPLAIN [explain_type] dml_statement;
   explain_type:
       BASIC
     | OUTLINE
     | EXTENDED
     | EXTENDED_NOADDR
     | PARTITIONS
     | FORMAT = {TRADITIONAL| JSON}
