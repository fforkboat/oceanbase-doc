Data comparison rules 
==========================================



ApsaraDB for OceanBase allows two or more types of data to be compared. The following list describes the possible comparison results:

* A non-zero value or TRUE




<!-- -->

* 0 or False




<!-- -->

* NULL




If the data types involved in a comparison are different, ApsaraDB for OceanBase automatically determines a data type for the comparison based on specific rules. Before comparison, the data is converted to this data type.

If the comparison type is text, you must also determine a collation for comparison.
