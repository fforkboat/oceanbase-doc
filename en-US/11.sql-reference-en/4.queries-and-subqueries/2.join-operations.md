JOIN operations 
====================================



The JOIN statement is used to combine two or more tables based on the JOIN conditions. The sets that are created by executing JOIN statements can be saved or used as tables. The JOIN statement is used to combine the properties of two tables based on the values in the tables. The JOIN types in a database include inner join, outer join, semi join, and anti join. Semi join and anti join are obtained by rewriting subqueries. SQL itself does not support the anti join or semi join expression.

JOIN conditions 
------------------------

JOIN conditions can be divided into equi join and non-equi join. Examples of equi join and non-equi join: t1.a = t2.b and t1.a \< t2.b. Compared with non-equi join, one of the benefits of equi join is that it allows you to use efficient JOIN algorithms such as hash join and merge-sort join.

Self-join 
------------------

Self join indicates that a table is joined with itself. The following figure shows an example of a self join.

```javascript
OceanBase (root@test)> create table t1(a int primary key, b int, c int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.70 sec)
--- Example of a self join
OceanBase (root@test)> select * from t1 as ta, t1 as tb where ta.b = tb.b
```





Inner join 
-------------------

Inner join is one of the most basic JOIN operations in a database. Inner join creates a new table that combines the columns of two tables (such as Table A and Table B) based on the JOIN conditions. A query compares each row in Table A with each row in Table B and finds combinations that satisfy the JOIN conditions. If a row in Table A and a row in Table B satisfy the JOIN conditions, the two rows are merged into one row in the new table. The result set of the JOIN operation is the outcome of first obtaining the Cartesian product of two tables and then returning all rows that match the JOIN conditions. A Cartesian product is also known as a cross join, which returns a result table where each row from Table A is combined with each row from Table B.

Outer join 
-------------------

Outer join does not require each record of the two joined tables to find a matching record in the other table. If all the records in a table, including non-matching records, are retained in the joined tables, this table is called a preserved table **.** Outer join can be divided into left outer join, right outer join, and full outer join based on whether to retain rows from the left, right, or both tables. If a row in the left table is not found in the right table, left outer join automatically returns NULL in the right table. If a row in the right table is not found in the left table, right outer join automatically returns NULL in the left table. If rows in the left and right tables do not match, full outer join automatically returns NULL in the tables.

Semi join 
------------------

When Table A and Table B are left semi-joined, the operation only returns all rows in Table A that can be found in Table B. Right semi join only returns all rows in Table B that can be found in Table A. Semi join can only be obtained by subquery unnesting, as shown in the following figure.

```javascript
OceanBase (root@test)> create table t1(a int primary key, b int, c int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.70 sec)
OceanBase (root@test)> create table t2(a int primary key, b int, c int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.92 sec)
--- A dependent subquery is unnested and rewritten as a semi join.
OceanBase (root@test)> explain select * from t1 where t1.a in (select t2.b from t2 where t2.c = t1.c);
| =======================================
|ID|OPERATOR      |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
---------------------------------------
|0 |HASH SEMI JOIN|    |1        |2924|
|1 | TABLE SCAN   |t1  |1000     |455 |
|2 | TABLE SCAN   |t2  |1000     |455 |
=======================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.a], [t1.b], [t1.c]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([t1.a = t2.b], [t2.c = t1.c]), other_conds(nil)
  1 - output([t1.c], [t1.a], [t1.b]), filter(nil),
      access([t1.c], [t1.a], [t1.b]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([t2.c], [t2.b]), filter(nil),
      access([t2.c], [t2.b]), partitions(p0)
```





Anti join 
------------------

When Table A and Table B are left anti-joined, the operation only returns all rows in Table A that cannot be found in Table B. Right anti join only returns all rows in Table B that cannot be found in Table A. Similar to semi join, anti join can be obtained only by subquery unnesting, as shown in the following figure.

```javascript
OceanBase (root@test)> create table t1(a int primary key, b int, c int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.70 sec)
OceanBase (root@test)> create table t2(a int primary key, b int, c int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.92 sec)
--- A dependent subquery is rewritten as an anti join.
OceanBase (root@test)> explain select * from t1 where t1.a not in (select t2.b from t2 where t2.c = t1.c);
| =======================================
|ID|OPERATOR      |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|

|0 |HASH ANTI JOIN|    |995      |3262|
|1 | TABLE SCAN   |t1  |1000     |455 |
|2 | TABLE SCAN   |t2  |1000     |455 |
=======================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.a], [t1.b], [t1.c]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([t2.c = t1.c]), other_conds([t1.a = t2.b OR (T_OP_IS, t2.b, NULL, 0)])
  1 - output([t1.c], [t1.a], [t1.b]), filter(nil),
      access([t1.c], [t1.a], [t1.b]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([t2.c], [t2.b]), filter(nil),
      access([t2.c], [t2.b]), partitions(p0)
```
