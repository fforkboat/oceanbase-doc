Character sets 
===================================



ApsaraDB for OceanBase supports the following character sets:

* `UTF8MB4`: variable-length encoding. The maximum length is 4 bytes.




<!-- -->

* `BINARY`: fixed-length encoding. The fixed length is 1 byte.




`UTF8` (or `UTF8MB3)` is a subset of `UTF8MB4`. UTF8 is a variable-length encoding scheme that uses a maximum of 3 bytes to encode a character. To support seamless migration, ApsaraDB for OceanBase considers `UTF8` as the synonym of `UTF8MB4` in terms of the syntax.
