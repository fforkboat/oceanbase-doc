Arithmetic operators 
=========================================



The following table lists all arithmetic operators.


|   Operator   |     Operand     |                                              Description                                               |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `+`          | Unary or binary | As a unary operator, it indicates a positive number. As a binary operator, it indicates an addition.   |
| `-`          | Unary or binary | As a unary operator, it indicates a negative number. As a binary operator, it indicates a subtraction. |
| `*`          | Binary          | The multiplication operator.                                                                           |
| `/`          | Binary          | The division operator.                                                                                 |
| `DIV`        | Binary          | Divides an integer and returns the quotient.                                                           |
| `MOD` or `%` | Binary          | Divides an integer and returns the remainder.                                                          |



Integer division complies with the following rules:

* The quotient is rounded towards zero regardless of whether the quotient is positive or negative.




<!-- -->

* The remainder has the same sign as the dividend.




Examples

```javascript
OceanBase (root@oceanbase)> SELECT (-7) DIV (3.6), (-7) MOD (3.6);
+----------------+----------------+
| (-7) DIV (3.6) | (-7) MOD (3.6) |
+----------------+----------------+
|             -1 |           -3.4 |
+----------------+----------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

OceanBase (root@oceanbase)> SELECT (-7) DIV (-3.4), (-7) % (-3.4);
+-----------------+---------------+
| (-7) DIV (-3.4) | (-7) % (-3.4) |
+-----------------+---------------+
|               2 |          -0.2 |
+-----------------+---------------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
```
