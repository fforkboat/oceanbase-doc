Comparison operators 
=========================================



The following table lists all comparison operators.


|      Operator       | Operand |                   Description                    |       Effect of NULL on the operators       |
|---------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `=`                 | Binary  | The equal operator.                              | The result is NULL.                         |
| `&lt;&gt;`/`! =`    | Binary  | The not equal operator.                          | The result is NULL.                         |
| `&gt;`              | Binary  | The greater than operator.                       | The result is NULL.                         |
| `&gt;=`             | Binary  | The greater than or equal operator.              | The result is NULL.                         |
| `&lt;`              | Binary  | The less than operator.                          | The result is NULL.                         |
| `&lt;=`             | Binary  | The less than or equal operator.                 | The result is NULL.                         |
| `[NOT] IN`          | Binary  | Specifies whether the value is in the set.       | For more information, see the descriptions. |
| `[NOT] BETWEEN AND` | Ternary | Specifies whether the value is within the range. | For more information, see the descriptions. |
| `IS [NOT] TRUE`     | Unary   | Specifies whether the value is equal to TRUE.    | The result is TRUE or FALSE.                |
| `IS [NOT] FALSE`    | Unary   | Specifies whether the value is equal to FALSE.   | The result is TRUE or FALSE.                |
| `IS [NOT] NULL`     | Unary   | Specifies whether the value is equal to NULL.    | The result is TRUE or FALSE.                |
| `&lt;=&gt;`         | Binary  | The NULL-safe equal operator.                    | The result is TRUE or FALSE.                |





The following list describes the special treatment of the NULL value by some operators.

Examples

```javascript
OceanBase (root@oceanbase)> SELECT 1 IN (1, NULL), 1 IN (2, NULL);
+----------------+----------------+
| 1 IN (1, NULL) | 1 IN (2, NULL) |
+----------------+----------------+
|              1 |           NULL |
+----------------+----------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

OceanBase (root@oceanbase)> SELECT 1 BETWEEN 0 AND NULL, 1 BETWEEN 2 AND NULL;
+----------------------+----------------------+
| 1 BETWEEN 0 AND NULL | 1 BETWEEN 2 AND NULL |
+----------------------+----------------------+
|                 NULL |                    0 |
+----------------------+----------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
