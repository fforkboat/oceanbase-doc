Concatenation operators 
============================================



The following table lists all concatenation operators.


| Operator | Operand |        Description        |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| `||`     | Binary  | Concatenates two strings. |



Based on the preceding description, the `||` operator can also be used as a logical OR operator. The semantic meaning of the operator is controlled by the SQL mode.

* If the SQL mode is `PIPES_AS_CONCAT`, `||` is an operator that concatenates strings.




<!-- -->

* If the SQL mode is not `PIPES_AS_CONCAT`, `||` is a logical OR operator.
