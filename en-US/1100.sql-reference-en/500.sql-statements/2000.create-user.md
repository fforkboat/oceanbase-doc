| user_name                                | The username. After a user is created, a new row is added for the user to the mysql.user table. If the username is used, the system returns an error. |
| IDENTIFIED BY                            | Set a password for the user.                                                                                                                          |
| user_name \[, user_name ...\]            | To create multiple users at a time, separate them with commas (,).                                                                                    |
| user IDENTIFIED BY 'authstring'          | The plaintext password. After the password is saved to the mysql.user table, the password is stored in ciphertext on the server.                      |
| user IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD 'hashstring' | The ciphertext password.                                                                                                                              |



Examples 
-----------------

1. Create users sqluser01 and sqluser02, and set their password to 123456. 




```javascript
CREATE USER 'sqluser01' IDENTIFIED BY '123456', 'sqluser02' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
```



2. View the users you create.




```javascript
SELECT user FROM mysql.user;
```



Output:

```javascript
mysql> CREATE USER 'sqluser01' IDENTIFIED BY '123456', 'sqluser02' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
