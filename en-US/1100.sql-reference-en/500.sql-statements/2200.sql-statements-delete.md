DELETE 
===========================



Description 
--------------------

You can execute the DELETE statement to delete rows that can satisfy specified conditions from one or more tables.

Syntax 
---------------

```javascript
Single-Table-Delete Syntax:
    DELETE [hint_options] FROM tbl_name
    [PARTITION (partition_name,...)]
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [ORDER BY order_expression_list]
    [LIMIT row_count]

Multiple-Table-Delete Syntax:
    DELETE [hint_options] tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[. *]] ...
    FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]
Or:
    DELETE [hint_options] FROM tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[. *]] ...
    USING table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]
 
where_condition:
    expression

order_expression_list:
    order_expression [, order_expression ...]

order_expression:
    expression [ASC | DESC]

limit_row_count:
    INT_VALUE
  
table_references:
    {tbl_name | joined_table | table_subquery | select_with_parens} [, ...]
 
```



Parameters 
-------------------



|     **Parameter**     |                                                    **Description**                                                    |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Examples 
-----------------

The following examples are based on tables t1 and t2.

```javascript
OceanBase(admin@test)>create table t1(c1 int primary key, c2 int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.16 sec)
OceanBase(admin@test)>select * from t1;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  1 |    1 |
|  2 |    2 |
|  3 |    3 |
|  4 |    4 |
+----+------+
4 rows in set (0.06 sec)

OceanBase(admin@test)>create table t2(c1 int primary key, c2 int) partition by key(c1) partitions 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.19 sec)
OceanBase(admin@test)>select * from t2;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  5 |    5 |
|  1 |    1 |
|  2 |    2 |
|  3 |    3 |
+----+------+
4 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```



* Delete a row from a table: Delete a row where the value for the c1 column is equal to 2. The c1 column is the primary key of the t1 table.




```javascript
OceanBase(admin@test)>DELETE FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 2;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

OceanBase(admin@test)>select * from t1;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  1 |    1 |
|  3 |    3 |
|  4 |    4 |
+----+------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```



* Delete a row from a table: Sort the rows in the t2 table by the c2 column, and delete the first row.




```javascript
OceanBase(admin@test)>DELETE FROM t1 ORDER BY c2 LIMIT 1;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

OceanBase(admin@test)>select * from t1;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  2 |    2 |
|  3 |    3 |
|  4 |    4 |
+----+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```



* Delete a row from a table: Delete the p2 partition data from the t2 table.




```javascript
OceanBase(admin@test)>DELETE FROM t2 PARTITION(p2);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.02 sec)

OceanBase(admin@test)>select * from t2;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  5 |    5 |
+----+------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
```



* Delete rows from multiple tables: In the t1 and t2 tables, find the rows where the value for the c1 column in t1 is equal to that in t2, and delete the rows from t1 and t2.




```javascript
OceanBase(admin@test)>DELETE t1, t2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1;
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.02 sec)

OceanBase(admin@test)>select * from t1;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  4 |    4 |
+----+------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

OceanBase(admin@test)>select * from t2;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  5 |    5 |
+----+------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```



* Delete rows from multiple tables: In the t1 and t2 tables, find the rows where the value for the c1 column in t1 is equal to that in t2, and delete the rows from t1 and t2.




```javascript
OceanBase(admin@test)>DELETE FROM t1, t2 USING t1, t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1;
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.02 sec)

OceanBase(admin@test)>select * from t1;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  4 |    4 |
+----+------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

OceanBase(admin@test)>select * from t2;
Empty set (0.01 sec)
```



* Delete rows from multiple tables: In the t1 table and the p2 partition of the t2 table, find the rows where the value for the c1 column in t1 is equal to that in t2, and delete the rows from t1 and t2.




```javascript
OceanBase(admin@test)>DELETE t2 FROM t1,t2 PARTITION(p2) WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1;
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.02 sec)

OceanBase(admin@test)>select * from t2;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  5 |    5 |
+----+------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```



* Delete a row from updatable view v.




```javascript
OceanBase(admin@test)>create view v as select * from t1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)

OceanBase(admin@test)>delete from v where v.c1 = 1;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

OceanBase(admin@test)>select * from v;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  2 |    2 |
|  3 |    3 |
|  4 |    4 |
+----+------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```



Notes 
--------------

You cannot use subqueries to delete rows from one or more tables. For example, you cannot execute the following statement:

`delete from (select * from t1);`
