REVOKE 
===========================



Description 
--------------------

You can execute the REVOKE statement to revoke permissions from users as a system administrator.

Notes:

* To revoke permissions from a user, ensure that you have the permissions to be revoked. For example, to revoke the SELECT permission on Table 1 from User 2 as User 1, ensure that User 1 has this permission and the GRANT OPTION permission.

* To revoke the ALL PRIVILEGES or GRANT OPTION permission, ensure that you have the global permission to execute the GRANT OPTION statement or the UPDATE and DELETE permissions on the permission table.

* Revocations do not have cascading effects. Assume that User 1 has granted permissions to User 2. If you revoke permissions from User 1, the permissions are not revoked from User 2.
