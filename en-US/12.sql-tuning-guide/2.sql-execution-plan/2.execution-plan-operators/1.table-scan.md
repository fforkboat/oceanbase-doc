TABLE SCAN 
===============================

The `TABLE SCAN` operator provides an interface between the storage layer and SQL layer, and shows which index the optimizer selected when accessing data. 

In OceanBase Database, the table access logic for normal indexes is encapsulated in the `TABLE SCAN` operator. For global indexes, however, the logic of table access by index primary key is completed by the `TABLE LOOKUP` operator. 

Example: An execution plan with a `TABLE SCAN` operator

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT, c3 INT, c4 INT,  
      INDEX k1(c2,c3));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)

Q1:
obclient>EXPLAIN EXTENDED SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 1\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display shows in detail the output information of the `TABLE SCAN` operator.

| operator                                    | `TABLE SCAN` and `TABLE GET` are two forms of the `TABLE SCAN` operator.  * `TABLE SCAN` is a range scan and returns 0 or multiple rows of data.   * `TABLE GET` locates a row by using a primary key and returns 0 or 1 row of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| name                                        | Indicates the index selected for accessing data. The name of the selected index appears after the table name. The absence of the index name means that the primary table is scanned.  Note that, in OceanBase Database, the primary table has the same structure as the index, and the primary table is itself an index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| filter                                      | The filter predicates of the operator.  In this example, the condition is set to `nil` because no filter is configured for the `TABLE SCAN` operator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| partitions                                  | The partitions to be scanned in the query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| is_index_back                               | Indicates whether table access by index primary key is required by the operator.  For example, in query Q1,Table access by index primary key is not needed because the primary table is selected. In query Q2, where the indexed columns are `c2, c3, and c1`, table access by index primary key is required as the query needs to return column `c4`.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| filter_before_indexback                     | Corresponds to each filter, and indicates whether the filter directly applies to the index or after the `TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX PRIMARY KEY` operation.  For example, in query Q2, filter `c3 < 1`can be directly applied to the index, which reduces the number of `TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX PRIMARY KEY` operations. However, filter `c4 < 1` is applied only after column `c4` is fetched through table access.                                                                                                                                       |
|  range_key/range/range_cond | * `range_key`: the rowkey columns of the index.    <!-- --> * `range`: indicates the start and end positions in an index scan. You can tell if it is a full table scan by the value of range. For example, in a scenario with three rowkey columns, `range(MIN,MIN, MIN ; MAX, MAX, MAX)` definitely represents a full table scan.   * `range_cond`: predicates that determine the start and end positions of an index scan.    |
