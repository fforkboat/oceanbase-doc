View the shape of an execution plan and analyze the plan 
=============================================================================



To view the shape of an execution plan and analyze the plan, perform the following steps:

1. Run the `EXPLAIN` command to view the shape of the execution plan, or view the cached execution plan by real-time execution plan display. For more information, see [Introduction to SQL execution plan](../../../../12.sql-tuning-guide/2.sql-execution-plan/1.introduction-to-sql-execution-plan.md) and [Real-time execution plan display](../../../../12.sql-tuning-guide/2.sql-execution-plan/5.real-time-execution-plan-display.md).

   

2. Analyze the execution plan to determine whether your selection of the index, join order, and join algorithm is reasonable and correct. For more information, see [Access path](../../5.query-optimization/1.access-path/1.overview-of-access-path.md), [Join order](../../5.query-optimization/2.join-algorithm/3.join-order.md) and [Join algorithms](../../5.query-optimization/2.join-algorithm/2.join-algorithms.md).
