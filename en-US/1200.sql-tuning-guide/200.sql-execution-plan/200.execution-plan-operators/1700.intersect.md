INTERSECT 
==============================

The `INTERSECT` operator perform an intersection-set operation on the output of the left and right suboperators and deduplicates the result. 

`INTERSECT` operators supported by OceanBase Database include `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` and `HASH INTERSECT DISTINCT`. 

MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT 
---------------------------------------------

In the following example, Q1 connects the two queries with the `INTERSECT` operator. Because a sorting method is available for `c1`, the `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator is used as the No. 0 operator to obtain the intersection set and deduplicate the result. Because no sorting method is available for `c2`, a `SORT` operator is assigned before the No. 3 operator for sorting. When these operators are executed, they read ordered inputs from the left and right subnodes, and merge and deduplicate the rows to obtain the intersection set. 

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1,1);
Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2,2);
Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.12 sec)

Q1: 
obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT c1 FROM t1 INTERSECT SELECT c2 FROM t1\G;

|0 |MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT|    |2        |77  |

|2 | SORT                   |    |2        |39  |
|3 |  TABLE SCAN            |T1  |2        |37  |

Outputs & filters: 
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([INTERSECT(T1.C1, T1.C2)]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C1]), filter(nil), 
      access([T1.C1]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C2, ASC])
  3 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil), 
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```



In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section in the demo shows in detail the output information of the `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator.

|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| output    | The output expression of the operator.  The respective output of the two suboperators connected by using the `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator. It indicates a column in the output of the intersection-set operation. Within the brackets are the output columns of the left and right subnodes corresponding to this column. |
| filter    | The filter conditions of the operator.  In this example, the condition is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator.                                                                                                                                                    |



HASH INTERSECT DISTINCT 
--------------------------------------------

In the following example, Q2 uses the `INTERSECT` operator to connect the two queries. Because no sorting method is available, the `HASH INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator is used as the No. 0 operator to obtain the intersection set and deduplicate the result. When the operator is being executed, it first reads the output of the subnode on one side to create a hash table and removes duplicate rows. Then, it reads the output of the subnode on the other side, and uses the hash table to generate the difference set and deduplicate the result. 

```javascript
Q2: 
obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT c2 FROM t1 INTERSECT SELECT c2 FROM t1\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
================================================
|ID|OPERATOR               |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
------------------------------------------------
|0 |HASH INTERSECT DISTINCT|    |2        |77  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN            |T1  |2        |37  |
|2 | TABLE SCAN            |T1  |2        |37  |
================================================

Outputs & filters: 
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([INTERSECT(T1.C2, T1.C2)]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil), 
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil), 
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```



In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display shows in detail the output information of the `HASH INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator. Fields of the operator have the same meaning as that of the `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator.
