EXCHANGE 
=============================

The `EXCHANGE` operator exchanges data between threads. 

The `EXCHANGE` operator is useful in distributed scenarios. It usually appears in pairs, with an `EXCHANGE OUT` operator at the source side, and an `EXCHANGE IN` operator at the destination side. 

EXCH-IN/OUT 
--------------------------------

Short for `EXCHANGE IN/ EXCHANGE OUT`, the `EXCH-IN/OUT` operators aggregate data from multiple partitions and send them to the leader node involved in the query. 

In the following example, the query accesses 5 partitions: `p0`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`. The No. 1 operator receives the output of the No. 2 operator, and sends the data out. The No. 0 operator receives the output of the No. 1 operator from multiple partitions, aggregates them, and generates the result. 

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE t (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 5;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************

  1 - output([T.C1], [T.C2]), filter(nil)
  2 - output([T.C1], [T.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T.C1], [T.C2]), partitions(p[0-4])
```



In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section in the demo shows in detail the output information of the `EXCH-IN/OUT` operators.

|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | The output expression of the operator.                                                                                                                                        |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator.  In this example, the filter is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `EXCH-IN/OUT` operator. |



EXCH-IN/OUT (REMOTE) 
-----------------------------------------

The `EXCH-IN/OUT (REMOTE)` operators pull remote data in a single partition back to the local server. 

As shown in the following example, a non-partitioned table is created on server `A`, and a query is executed on server `B` to read data from that table. In this case, the No. 0 and No. 1 operators are assigned to the execution plan to fetch remote data. The No. 1 operator is executed on server A to read the data from table t and send the data out. The No. 0 operator is executed on server B to receive the output of the No. 1 operator. 

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE t (c1 INT, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
===============================================
|ID|OPERATOR            |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST  |
-----------------------------------------------
|0 |EXCHANGE IN REMOTE  |    |100000   |109029|
|1 | EXCHANGE OUT REMOTE|    |100000   |64066 |
|2 |  TABLE SCAN        |T   |100000   |64066 |
===============================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T.C1], [T.C2]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T.C1], [T.C2]), filter(nil)
  2 - output([T.C1], [T.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T.C1], [T.C2]), partitions(p0)
```



In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display shows in detail the output information of the `EXCH-IN/OUT (REMOTE)` operator. Fields of the operator have the same meaning as that of the `EXCH-IN/OUT` operator.

EXCH-IN/OUT (PKEY) 
---------------------------------------

The `EXCH-IN/OUT (PKEY)` operators repartition data. They are generally used with a binary operator pair to repartition the data of one subnode by following the partitioning method of the other subnode. 

In the following example, the query is to join two partitioned tables. The execution plan repartitions the data of table `s` by following the partitioning method of table `t`. The input of the No. 4 operator is the result of scanning table `s`, and for every row of table `s`, the operator determines its target node based on the partitioning of table `t` and the join condition of the query. 

In addition, it can be seen that the No. 3 operator is an `EXCHANGE IN MERGE SORT DISTR`, a special `EXCHANGE IN` operator that performs `MERGE` and `SORT` operations when aggregating data from multiple partitions. In this execution plan, the data received by the No. 3 operator from all partitions is sorted by `c1`, so the operator merges and sorts the received data to ensure that the output is also sorted by `c1`. 

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE t (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 5;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>CREATE TABLE s (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM s, t WHERE s.c1 = t.c1\G;

| filter | The filter conditions of the operator.  In this example, the filter is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `EXCH-IN/OUT(PKEY)` operator. |
| pkey   | The column based on which the repartitioning is performed.  For example, `#keys=1, [s.c1]` indicates that the repartitioning is performed based on column `c1`.     |



EXCH-IN/OUT (HASH) 
---------------------------------------

The `EXCH-IN/OUT (HASH)` operators repartition data by using a set of `HASH` functions. 

In the execution plan shown in the following example, operators 3 - 5 and 7 - 8 are two sets of `EXCHANGE` operators that use `HASH` function for repartitioning. These two groups of operators partition the data of tables `t` and `s` into multiple parts based on a new set of `HASH` functions. In the example, the columns `t.c2` and `s.c2` are taken for the hash operation, to ensure that rows with the same value in column `c2` are grouped in the same part. Based on the repartitioned data, `HASH JOIN`, or the No. 2 operator, merges all parts based on the condition `t.c2= s.c2`. 

Additionally, the plan shows `dop = 2` because the query is executed with a degree of parallelism of `2`. 

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE t (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>CREATE TABLE s (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT /*+PQ_DISTRIBUTE(@"SEL$1" ("TEST.S"@"SEL$1" ) HASH HASH), 
             PARALLEL(2)*/ * FROM t, s WHERE t.c2 = s.c2\G;

The `PX PARTITION ITERATO` operator iterates data at the partition level. For more information, see [GI](../200.execution-plan-operators/2400.gi.md).

EXCH-IN/OUT (BROADCAST) 
--------------------------------------------

The `EXCH-IN/OUT (BROADCAST)` operators repartition the input data by using the `BROADCAST` method and broadcasts the data to other threads. 

In the execution plan shown in the following example, operators 3 and 4 are `EXCHANGE` operators that use `BROADCAST` repartitioning. They broadcast the data of Table `t` to every thread, and try to join each partition of table `s` with the broadcast data of table `t` . 

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE t (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>CREATE TABLE s (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)
