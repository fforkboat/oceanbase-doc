Execution of parallel queries 
==================================================

Parallel execution involves the division of a large task into multiple small tasks, which are processed in parallel by multiple threads or processes. Parallel execution uses more CPU and I/O resources to reduce the response time. 

Parallel execution involves parallel queries, parallel data definition language (DDL) operations, and parallel data manipulation language (DML) operations. OceanBase Database V2.2.76 only supports parallel queries, but it does not support parallel DDL or DML operations. 

You can run parallel queries in the following scenarios:

* You can use the `PARALLEL` hint to specify the degree of parallelism (DOP) of a query and execute this query in parallel.

  

* The system automatically runs a parallel query on a partitioned table that has more than one partitions.

  




Run a parallel query on a partitioned table 
----------------------------------------------------------------

For a partitioned table that has more than one partition to be queried, the system automatically runs a parallel query. By default, the degree of parallelism (DOP) for the query is 1. 

In the following example, a partitioned table ptable is created and a full table scan is performed on the entire table. You can run the `EXPLAIN` command to view the execution plan generated by the optimizer. 

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE PTABLE(c1 INT , c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 16;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM ptable\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
=======================================================
|ID|OPERATOR               |NAME    |EST. ROWS|COST   |
-------------------------------------------------------
|0 |EXCHANGE IN DISTR      |        |1600000  |1246946|
|1 | EXCHANGE OUT DISTR    |:EX10000|1600000  |1095490|
|2 |  PX PARTITION ITERATOR|        |1600000  |1095490|
|3 |   TABLE SCAN          |ptable  |1600000  |1095490|
=======================================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter(nil), dop=1
  2 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter(nil)
  3 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter(nil),
      access([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), partitions(p[0-15])
```



The execution plan shows that the default DOP for a parallel query is 1 for a partitioned table. Assume that your OceanBase cluster has 3 OBServers, and the table ptable has 16 partitions scattered in these 3 OBServers. Each OBServer will start a worker thread to scan data in these partitions, which means a total of 3 worker threads are started. 

To query a partitioned table, you can add the `PARALLEL` hint to the query to set the DOP to a number greater than or equal to 2 to manually run a parallel query. Then, you can run the `EXPLAIN` command to view the execution plan generated by the optimizer. 

```javascript
obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ PARALLEL(8) */ * FROM ptable\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
=======================================================
|ID|OPERATOR               |NAME    |EST. ROWS|COST   |
-------------------------------------------------------
|0 |EXCHANGE IN DISTR      |        |1600000  |1246946|
|1 | EXCHANGE OUT DISTR    |:EX10000|1600000  |1095490|
|2 |  PX PARTITION ITERATOR|        |1600000  |1095490|
|3 |   TABLE SCAN          |ptable  |1600000  |1095490|
=======================================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter(nil), dop=8
  2 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter(nil)
  3 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter(nil),
      access([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), partitions(p[0-15])
```



In this execution plan, the DOP for parallel query is 8. If the number of OBServers where the queried partition is located is less than or equal to the DOP, the worker threads (the total number is equal to the DOP) are assigned to the queried OBServers based on the specified rule. If the number of queried OBServers is greater than the DOP, each OBServer starts at least one worker thread. Therefore, the total number of worker threads can be greater than the DOP. 

For example, if `DOP = 8` and 16 partitions are evenly distributed on 4 OBServers, each OBServer starts 2 worker threads to scan the corresponding partitions (a total of 8 worker threads are started). If 16 partitions are evenly distributed on 16 OBServers (one partition for a node), each OBServer starts one worker thread to scan the corresponding partition (a total of 16 worker threads are started). 

To query a partitioned table that has zero or one partition to be queried, the system does not run a parallel query. The following example shows that a filter condition `c1 = 1` is added to the query on ptable. 

```javascript
obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM ptable WHERE c1 = 1\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
======================================
|ID|OPERATOR  |NAME  |EST. ROWS|COST |
--------------------------------------
|0 |TABLE SCAN|ptable|990      |85222|
======================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter([ptable.c1 = 1]),
      access([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), partitions(p1)
```



The plan indicates that only one partition needs to be queried. So, the system did not run a parallel query. To run a parallel query on a single partition, you can only add the `PARALLEL` hint to the query. Then, you can run the `EXPLAIN` command to view the execution plan generated by the optimizer. 

```javascript
obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ PARALLEL(8) */ * FROM ptable WHERE c1 = 1\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
=================================================
|ID|OPERATOR           |NAME    |EST. ROWS|COST |
-------------------------------------------------
|0 |EXCHANGE IN DISTR  |        |990      |85316|
|1 | EXCHANGE OUT DISTR|:EX10000|990      |85222|
|2 |  PX BLOCK ITERATOR|        |990      |85222|
|3 |   TABLE SCAN      |ptable  |990      |85222|
=================================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter(nil), dop=8
  2 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter(nil)
  3 - output([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), filter([ptable.c1 = 1]),
      access([ptable.c1], [ptable.c2]), partitions(p1)
```


**Notice**



* To execute a query in parallel on a single partition, you can add the `PARALLEL` hint to the query to set the DOP of the query to a value greater than or equal to two.

  

* If the DOP value of a query is null or less than two, the system does run a parallel query.

  




Run a parallel query on a non-partitioned table 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A non-partitioned table is essentially a partitioned table with only one partition. Therefore, you can execute a query in parallel on this partition only by adding the `PARALLEL` hint to this query. Otherwise, the system does not run a parallel query. 

In the following example, a non-partitioned table stable is created and a `FULL TABLE SCAN` is performed on the entire table. You can run the `EXPLAIN` command to view the execution plan generated by the optimizer. 

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE stable(c1 INT, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM stable\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
======================================
|ID|OPERATOR  |NAME  |EST. ROWS|COST |
--------------------------------------
|0 |TABLE SCAN|stable|100000   |68478|
======================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([stable.c1], [stable.c2]), filter(nil),
      access([stable.c1], [stable.c2]), partitions(p0)
```



The execution plan shows that the system does not run a parallel query on a non-partitioned table if no hint is added to the query. 

You can add the `PARALLEL` hint to a query and set its DOP to a value greater than or equal to 2 to run a parallel query on a non-partitioned table. Then, you can run the `EXPLAIN` command to view the execution plan generated by the optimizer. 

```javascript
obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ PARALLEL(4)*/  * FROM stable\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
=================================================
|ID|OPERATOR           |NAME    |EST. ROWS|COST |
-------------------------------------------------
|0 |EXCHANGE IN DISTR  |        |100000   |77944|
|1 | EXCHANGE OUT DISTR|:EX10000|100000   |68478|
|2 |  PX BLOCK ITERATOR|        |100000   |68478|
|3 |   TABLE SCAN      |stable  |100000   |68478|
=================================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([stable.c1], [stable.c2]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([stable.c1], [stable.c2]), filter(nil), dop=4
  2 - output([stable.c1], [stable.c2]), filter(nil)
  3 - output([stable.c1], [stable.c2]), filter(nil),
      access([stable.c1], [stable.c2]), partitions(p0)
```



Run a parallel query across multiple tables 
----------------------------------------------------------------

Multi-table join queries are the most frequently used. 

In the following example, partitioned tables `p1table` and `p2table` are created.

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE p1table(c1 INT ,c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

obclient>CREATE TABLE p2table(c1 INT ,c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```



Use the join condition `p1table.c1=p2table.c2` to join the result sets for a query on `p1table` and `p2table`. Execution plan for the query:

```javascript
obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT  * FROM p1table p1 JOIN p2table p2 ON p1.c1=p2.c2\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
====================================================================
|ID|OPERATOR                          |NAME    |EST. ROWS|COST     |
--------------------------------------------------------------------
|0 |EXCHANGE IN DISTR                 |        |784080000|614282633|
|1 | EXCHANGE OUT DISTR               |:EX10001|784080000|465840503|
|2 |  HASH JOIN                       |        |784080000|465840503|
|3 |   EXCHANGE IN DISTR              |        |200000   |155887   |
|4 |    EXCHANGE OUT DISTR (BROADCAST)|:EX10000|200000   |136955   |
|5 |     PX PARTITION ITERATOR        |        |200000   |136955   |
|6 |      TABLE SCAN                  |p1      |200000   |136955   |
|7 |   PX PARTITION ITERATOR          |        |400000   |273873   |
|8 |    TABLE SCAN                    |p2      |400000   |273873   |
====================================================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2], [p2.c1], [p2.c2]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2], [p2.c1], [p2.c2]), filter(nil), dop=1
  2 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2], [p2.c1], [p2.c2]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([p1.c1 = p2.c2]), other_conds(nil)
  3 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2]), filter(nil)
  4 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2]), filter(nil), dop=1
  5 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2]), filter(nil)
  6 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2]), filter(nil),
      access([p1.c1], [p1.c2]), partitions(p[0-1])
  7 - output([p2.c1], [p2.c2]), filter(nil)
  8 - output([p2.c1], [p2.c2]), filter(nil),
      access([p2.c1], [p2.c2]), partitions(p[0-3])
```



By default, the system executes the query in parallel on both `p1table` and `p2table` because they both have more than one partition to be queried. The default value of DOP is 1. Likewise, you can change the DOP of a query by adding the `PARALLEL` hint to it. 

In the following example, the `JOIN` condition is changed to `p1table.c1=p2table.c2`and `p2table.c1=1`, so that only a single partition is selected for `p2table`. The execution plan is:

```javascript
obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT  * FROM p1table p1 JOIN p2table p2 ON p1.c1=p2.c2 AND p2.c1=1\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************

=============================================================

  0 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2], [p2.c1], [p2.c2]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2], [p2.c1], [p2.c2]), filter(nil), dop=1
  2 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2], [p2.c1], [p2.c2]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([p1.c1 = p2.c2]), other_conds(nil)
  3 - output([p2.c1], [p2.c2]), filter(nil)
  4 - (#keys=1, [p2.c2]), output([p2.c1], [p2.c2]), filter(nil), dop=1

  6 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2]), filter(nil)
  7 - output([p1.c1], [p1.c2]), filter(nil),
      access([p1.c1], [p1.c2]), partitions(p[0-1])
```



In this plan, `p2table` only has one partition be scanned and `p2table` has two. By default, a parallel query is run on `p1table` and not run on `p2table`. Likewise, you can change the DOP of a query by adding the `PARALLEL` hint to it. Then, you can execute a query in parallel on a single partition of `p2table` as well.

System view for parallel execution 
-------------------------------------------------------

OceanBase Database provides a system view `gv$sql_audit/v$sql_audit` to demonstrate the status and some statistics for parallel execution. 

The `gv$sql_audit/v$sql_audit` view has many fields, among which `qc_id`, `dfo_id`, `sqc_id`, and `worker_id` are related to parallel execution. 

For more information, see [Introduction to (g)v$sql_audit](../400.sql-tuning/300.monitor-the-sql-execution-performance/100.g-v-sql_audit-introduction.md).
