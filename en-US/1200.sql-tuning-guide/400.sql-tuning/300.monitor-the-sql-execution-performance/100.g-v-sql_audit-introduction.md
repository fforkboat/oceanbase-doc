(g)v$sql_audit introduction 
================================================

`(g)v$sql_audit` is the global SQL audit table. It shows the client of every query, information about execution server, execution status, wait events, and time consumed for each execution stage. 

sql_audit settings 
---------------------------

* Set the switch of `sql_audit`. 

  ```javascript
  obclient>ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_sql_audit = true;
  /*Enable sql_audit*/
  
  obclient>ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_sql_audit = false;
  /*Disable sql_audit*/
  ```

  




<!-- -->

* Set the maximum memory usage of `sql_audit`. By default, the maximum memory usage is 3G, and it can be configured in the range of \[64M, +âˆž\]. 

  ```javascript
  obclient>ALTER SYSTEM SET sql_audit_memory_limit = '3G';
  ```

  




sql_audit eviction mechanism 
-------------------------------------

* sql_audit check its backend task once every other 1s and determines whether to start eviction based on the following criteria:

  * The maximum memory that can be utilized by `sql_audit` is determined by `avail_mem_limit = min (available memory at the OBServer * 10%`, `sql_audit_memory_limit)`.

    
  

  
  <!-- -->

  
  <!-- -->

  * Eviction is also triggered when the number of records in `sql_audit` exceeds 9 million.

    
  

  




<!-- -->

* sql_audit stops eviction by the following criteria:

  * If the eviction is triggered by reaching the memory usage limit:

    
  

  
  <!-- -->

  
  <!-- -->

  * If the eviction is triggered by the record number limit, it is stopped when the number of record rows drops to 8 million.
