Plan cache view 
====================================

The plan cache view contains the status record of a plan cache, execution statistics of plans, and plan information. 

(g)v$plan_cache_stat 
-----------------------------

`(g)v$plan_cache_stat` records the status of each plan cache, and each plan cache has a record entry in this view.
