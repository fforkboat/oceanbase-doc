Use SQL Audit to analyze wait events in a query 
====================================================================



SQL Audit records the following information about wait events:

* The wait time of 4 types of wait events: `APPLICATION_WAIT_TIME`,` CONCURRENCY_WAIT_TIME`, `USER_IO_WAIT_TIME`, and `SCHEDULE_TIME`. Each type involves many specific wait events.

  

* The name of the most time-consuming wait event, which is indicated by `EVENT`, and the time consumed, which is indicated by `WAIT_TIME_MICRO`.

  

* The number of occurrences of all wait events, which is indicated by `TOTAL_WAITS`, and the total time consumed, which is indicated by `TOTAL_WAIT_TIME_MICRO`.

  




If a large amount of time is consumed by wait events, you can check `EVENT` for the most time-consuming wait event and see what caused the problem. 

In the following example, I/O wait is the main cause of time consumption. 

```sql
obclient>SELECT SQL_ID,  ELAPSED_TIME, QUEUE_TIME,  GET_PLAN_TIME, EXECUTE_TIME, 
     APPLICATION_WAIT_TIME, CONCURRENCY_WAIT_TIME, USER_IO_WAIT_TIME, SCHEDULE_TIME, EVENT, 
      WAIT_CLASS,  WAIT_TIME_MICRO, TOTAL_WAIT_TIME_MICRO 
     FROM v$sql_audit 
     WHERE TRACE_ID = 'YB42AC1E87E6-0005B8AB2D578471'\G;
