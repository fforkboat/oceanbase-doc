Analyze queries related to distributed plans 
=================================================================



You can analyze queries related to distributed plans by the following steps:

1. Verify that the execution plan is a distributed plan by checking the execution plan type records in the `(g)v$plan_cache_plan_stat` and `(g)v$sql_audit` views.

   

2. Analyze the correctness of the execution plan.

   

3. Query `gv$sql_audit` by using trace_id, and check the response time of all executed subplans. As the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) execution of each subplan corresponds to an sql_audit record, you can analyze the sql_audit record to locate the problem.

   




In the following example, `is_executor_rpc = 1` indicates the sql_audit record is for a subplan execution, and it mostly stores information related to that execution. `is_executor_rpc = 0` indicates the `sql_audit` record is for a thread that accepted the SQL request. This record contains information about the SQL execution process, including information about the SQL and the obtained execution plan. 

```sql
obclient>SELECT/*+ PARALLEL(15)*/sql_id, is_executor_rpc, elapsed_time 
           FROM oceanbase.gv$sql_audit WHERE trace_id = 'YB420AB74FC6-00056349D323483A';
