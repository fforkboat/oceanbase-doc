Analyze slow SQL queries 
=============================================



You can analyze a slow SQL query through the following ways:

* View the statistics of the SQL query in the `sql_audit` table and analyze its SQL execution plan. 

  For more information, see [Analyze SQL queries that cause an abrupt RT jitter](../400.examples-of-sql-performance-analysis/200.analyze-sql-queries-that-cause-an-abrupt-rt-jitter.md).
  

* Verify whether the execution plan is correct. For more information, see [View the shape of an execution plan and analyze the plan](../400.examples-of-sql-performance-analysis/300.view-the-shape-of-an-execution-plan-and-analyze-the-plan.md).
