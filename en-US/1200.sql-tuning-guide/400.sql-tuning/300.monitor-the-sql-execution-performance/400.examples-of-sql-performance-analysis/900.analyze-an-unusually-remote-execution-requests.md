# Analyze whether an unusually large number of remote execution requests exist in the system or the execution of an SQL statement 

You can run the following SQL statement to analyze how many times different types of plans are executed in a certain period of time:
```javascript
obclient>SELECT COUNT(*),plan_type FROM oceanbase.gv$sql_audit WHERE tenant_id = 1001          
AND  IS_EXECUTOR_RPC = 0          
AND  request_time > (time_to_usec(now()) - 10000000)         
AND  request_time < time_to_usec(now()) 
GROUP BY plan_type ;
```
Generally, a large number of remote execution requests may be the result of a follower-to-leader switchover, or inaccurate routing on the Proxy client.
