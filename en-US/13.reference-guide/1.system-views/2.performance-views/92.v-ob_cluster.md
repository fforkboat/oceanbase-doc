| created                     | timestamp(6)        | NO         | The time when the cluster was created.                                                                                                                                                             |
| cluster_role                      | varchar(4096)          | NO         | The role of the cluster. Valid values: <ul> <li>PRIMARY: indicates a primary cluster.</li> <li> PHYSICAL STANDBY: indicates a standby cluster.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                            |
| cluster_status                   | varchar(4096)          | NO         | The status of the cluster. Valid values:</br> <ul> <li> `VALID`: The cluster is valid.</li> <li> `DISABLED`: Data synchronization is disabled for the cluster.</li></ul>The default cluster status is `VALID`. You can disable synchronization for a standby cluster on the primary cluster. During a failover, the new primary cluster automatically sets the status of other standby clusters to `DISABLED`, which means that data synchronization between the primary cluster and standby clusters is disabled.                                                                                                                                                      |
| switchover#                       | bigint(20)          | NO         | The unique ID of a switchover or failover operation.                                                                                                                                                      |
| switchover_status                   | varchar(4096)          | NO         | The switchover status of the cluster. Valid values: </br><ul><li> `NOT ALLOWED`: </li><ul><li> If the status of the primary cluster is `NOT ALLOWED`, it indicates that the primary cluster cannot be switched to become a standby cluster.  </li><li> If the status of the standby cluster is `NOT ALLOWED`, it indicates that the standby cluster cannot be switched to become a primary cluster. </li></ul><li> `TO PRIMARY`: Only a standby cluster can have this status. It indicates that the standby cluster can be switched to become a primary cluster. </li><li> `TO STANDBY`: Only the primary cluster can have this status. It indicates that the primary cluster can be switched to become a standby cluster. </li><li> `SWITCHOVER SWITCHING`: This status indicates that the primary cluster is in the process of being switched to become a standby cluster. A cluster in this state cannot provide write services and internal logging is suspended. </li><li> `FAILOVER FLASHBACK`: The standby cluster is in the process of being switched to become the primary cluster and data flashback is being performed to ensure consistency between the clusters. A cluster in this state cannot provide write services. You can keep executing the failover statement until the cluster becomes the primary cluster. </li><li> `FAILOVER CLEANUP`: The standby cluster is in the process of being switched to become the primary cluster and the cluster is performing final cleanup jobs, such as deleting invalid freeze information and schemas. A cluster in this state can provide write services but is unsuitable for DDL operations.                                                                                                                                 |
| switchover_info            | varchar(4096)          | NO         | The information related to the switchover of the cluster. The value of this field is related to the value of the `SWITCHOVER_STATUS` field.<ul><li> `NOT ALLOWED`: The field provides the reason why switchover is not allowed for the cluster. </li><li>`TO STANDBY`: The field lists the standby clusters that can be switched to become the primary cluster. </li><li>The field is empty for other states. </li></ul>Example values:<ul><li>`CHECK PRIMARY CLUSTER SERVER STATUS`: indicates that you need to check the states of servers in the primary cluster, because some servers may be offline. </li><li> `CHECK STADNBY CLUSTER SERVER STATUS`: indicates that you need to check the states of servers in the standby cluster, because some servers may be offline. </li><li> `CHECK PRIMARY CLUSTER REBALANCE TASK STATUS`: indicates that you need to check whether load balancing tasks of the primary cluster are completed. </li><li> `CHECK STANDBY CLUSTER REBALANCE TASK STATUS`: indicates that you need to check whether load balancing tasks of the standby cluster are completed. </li><li> `CHECK MERGE STATUS`: indicates that you need to check whether error codes exist in the compaction status. </li><li> `NONE SYNCED STANDBY CLUSTER`: indicates that the primary cluster cannot be switched to become a standby cluster because no standby cluster synchronous with the primary cluster exists. </li><li> `SYNCED STANDBY CLUSTERS: cluster1, cluster2`: lists the standby clusters that are synchronous with the primary cluster. </li><li> `CHECK SYS SCHEMA SYNC STATUS`: indicates that you need to check whether the synchronization of the schemas in the SYS tenant of the standby cluster is completed. </li><li> `CHECK USER SCHEMA SYNC STATUS`: indicates that you need to check whether the synchronization of the schemas in user tenants of the standby cluster is completed. </li><li> `CHECK FREEZE INFO SYNC STATUS`: indicates that you need to check whether the synchronization of the freeze information of the standby cluster is completed. </li><li> `CHECK ENOUG REPLICA`: indicates that you need to check whether the number of replicas in the standby cluster is enough. </li><li> `CHECK REDO LOG SYNC STATUS`: indicates that you need to check whether the synchronization of the redo logs of the standby cluster is completed. </li><li> `CAN NOT ACCESS CLUSTERS: cluster1, cluster2` : cluster1, cluster2: lists the standby clusters that cannot be accessed and whose states need to be checked. </li><li> `NO CLUSTER IN SWITCHING`: indicates that no cluster is in the `SWITCHING` state. Therefore, the `switchover to primary` operation cannot be performed. This value may be displayed for a standby cluster in the `NOT ALLOWED` state. </li><li> `INNER ERROR`: indicates that an internal error has occurred. You need to check the cluster log for troubleshooting. The related keyword in the log is `SWITCHOVER_STATUS`. </li><li> `PRIMARY CLUSTER NOT IN SYNC MODE`: In maximum protection and maximum availability modes, the log transfer mode of the primary cluster must be set to `SYNC`. After the switchover, the protection mode remains unchanged and the original primary cluster becomes a synchronous standby cluster. You can modify the log transfer mode on the primary cluster to `SYNC` to resolve the problem. </li><li> `STANDBY CLUSTER NOT IN SYNC MODE`: In maximum protection and maximum availability modes, you can switch a standby cluster only in `SYNC` mode to become the primary cluster. A standby cluster not in `SYNC` mode cannot be switched to become the primary cluster. </li><li> `PRIMARY CLUSTER HAS REPLICA IN RESTORE`: indicates that a switchover is not allowed because some replicas of the primary cluster have not been created. You must delete these replicas before a switchover can be performed. </li><li> `STANDBY CLUSTER HAS REPLICA IN RESTORE`: indicates that a switchover is not allowed because some replicas of the standby cluster have not been created. A switchover can be performed only after these replicas are created. </li><li> `PRIMARY CLUSTER DOING BACKUP`: indicates that switchover is not allowed for the primary cluster because it is being backed up. This is because backup is no longer supported after it is switched to become a standby cluster. You can stop the backup task. </li><li> `CHECK OTHER PRIMARY CLUSTE`: indicates that switchover is not allowed because another primary cluster exists. This is to prevent the situation where two primary clusters exist. </li></ul>                                                                                                                                  |

If no primary cluster exists, the value of this field is NULL.</li><li> For the primary cluster, the value of this field is NULL.</li></ul>The meaning of this field is different from that of Oracle. In Oracle, if a primary cluster was once a standby cluster, this field records the information about the last primary cluster, and if the primary cluster was never once a standby cluster, the value of this field is NULL.                                                                                                                                               |
