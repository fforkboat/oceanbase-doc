ob_ssl_invited_common_names 
================================================

ob_ssl_invited_common_names specifies the identity of an application running under the current tenant. The identity comes from the `cn` (common name) field of the subject of the client certificate in two-way Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) authentication. 


|            Property             | Description |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| Parameter type                  | String      |
| Default value                   | NONE        |
| Value range                     | N/A         |
| Effective upon OBServer restart | No          |



After the server verifies the username and password, it checks the following three conditions. If all of the three conditions are met, the logon is denied.

* Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) authentication is enabled for the client, and two-way authentication is used for the certificate authority (CA), certificate, or secret key of the client.

  

* An application whitelist is configured on the server, and the whitelist is not empty.

  

* The `cn` field of the subject of the client certificate is not included in the whitelist.

  




If none of these three conditions are met, the whitelist check fails and is ignored. 

Example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET ob_ssl_invited_common_names = 'ALIPAY';
```
