undo_retention 
===================================

`undo_retention` specifies the time range in seconds of data versions to be retained by the system. This variable is used to control the collection of data of multiple versions in minor compactions. 


|  **Property**   | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Parameter type  | int             |
| Default value   | 0               |
| Value range     | \[0, 2^32^)     |
| Effective scope | GLOBAL          |



The OceanBase database retains historical data rows of multiple versions for minor compaction data. You can set `undo_retention` to control the range of data versions retained in the minor compaction. 

Notes:

* When `undo_retention` is set to `0`, multi-version minor compaction is disabled, indicating that only the latest version of row data is retained in the minor compaction file.

  




<!-- -->

* When `undo_retention` is set to a value greater than `0`, multi-version minor compaction is enabled, and multiple versions of row data within the specified time period in seconds are retained in the minor compaction file.

  



**Notice**



After multi-version minor compaction is enabled for the tenant, the corresponding incremental minor compaction files are retained in a major compaction, but multi-version data is not stored in the Major SSTable To prevent the number of retained SSTable files from exceeding the limit, we recommend that you do not set this parameter to an excessively large value.
