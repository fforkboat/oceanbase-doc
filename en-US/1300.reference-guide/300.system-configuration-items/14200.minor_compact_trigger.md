minor_compact_trigger 
==========================================

minor_compact_trigger specifies the threshold for triggering the next level compaction in hierarchical minor compactions. When the total number of Mini SSTable files in the current level reaches this threshold, all SSTable files are compacted to the next level to form a new Minor SSTable file.

|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Parameter type                  | Integer         |

| Effective upon OBServer restart | No              |



When minor_compact_trigger is set to 0, the OceanBase database still performs hierarchical minor compactions, that is, MemTable files are still dumped into Mini SSTable files. However, the Mini SSTable files are immediately compacted into a new Minor SSTable file to replace the original Minor SSTable file.
