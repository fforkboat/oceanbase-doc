resource_hard_limit 
========================================

resource_hard_limit is used in unit allocation. 


|          **Property**           | **Description** |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| Parameter type                  | Integer         |
| Default value                   | 100             |
| Value range                     | \[1, 10000\]    |
| Effective upon OBServer restart | No              |



resource_hard_limit and resource_soft_limit are used together. 

* If the server resource usage is less than resource_soft_limit, units are allocated based on best_fit.

  

* If the server resource usage is greater than resource_soft_limit, units are allocated based on leaset_load.

  




During allocation of resources such as CPUs and memory, the total resource volume is the actual volume multiplied by 100%. The final server resource usage cannot exceed the value resource_hard_limit.
