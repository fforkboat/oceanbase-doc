The number of threads that can be processed simultaneously in a tenant is controlled by two configuration items: `cpu_quota_concurrency` and `workers_per_cpu_quota`. In addition, the value of workers_per_cpu_quota must be greater than that of cpu_quota_concurrency. 

Notes:

* `workers_per_cpu_quota`: specifies the maximum number of worker threads that a tenant can allocate to each CPU.

  

* `cpu_quota_concurrency`: specifies the number of active worker threads on each CPU of the tenant. For more information about the `cpu_quota_concurrency` configuration item, see [cpu_quota_concurrency](../300.system-configuration-items/3600.cpu_quota_concurrency.md).
