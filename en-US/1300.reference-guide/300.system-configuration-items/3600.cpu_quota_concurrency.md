cpu_quota_concurrency 
==========================================

cpu_quota_concurrency specifies the maximum concurrency allowed for each CPU quota of a tenant. 


|          **Property**           |            **Description**             |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Parameter type                  | Double-precision floating-point number |
| Default value                   | 4                                      |
| Value range                     | \[1, 10\]                              |
| Effective upon OBServer restart | No                                     |



The number of threads that can be concurrently handled by a tenant is controlled by two configuration items: cpu_quota_concurrency and workers_per_cpu_quota. The two configuration items must meet the following condition:

`workers_per_cpu_quota > cpu_quota_concurrency`

* `workers_per_cpu_quota` specifies the maximum number of workers that a tenant can allocate to each CPU.

  For more information about workers_per_cpu_quota, see [workers_per_cpu_quota](../300.system-configuration-items/20800.workers_per_cpu_quota.md).
  

* `cpu_quota_concurrency` specifies the number of active workers of the tenant on each CPU, that is, the number of concurrent works.

  



**Note**



When the physical machine has sufficient CPU resources, you can set `cpu_quota_concurrency` to a large value. If the physical machine has insufficient CPU resources, you can set `cpu_quota_concurrency` to a small value to avoid risks.
