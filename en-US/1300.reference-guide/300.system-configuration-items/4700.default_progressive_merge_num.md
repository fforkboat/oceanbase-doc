OceanBase Database supports performing progressive compactions on table data, that is, after performing a DDL operation that needs to rewrite the data, OceanBase Database can distribute data rewriting to multiple compaction operations. During each compaction, only some of the data is rewritten. You can use the table-level attribute `progressive_merge_num` to control the compaction, or use the `default_progressive_merge_num` parameter to set the default number of progressive compactions when a table is created. 

If you do not set the `progressive_merge_num` attribute, OceanBase Database sets its value to the value of `default_progressive_merge_num`. 

The values of `progressive_merge_num` are described as follows: 

* 0: indicates that 100 progressive compactions will be performed.

  

* 1: indicates that a full compaction will be forcibly executed without executing a progressive compaction.

  

* \> 1: indicates that the specified number of progressive compactions will be executed when a schema change occurs.
