OceanBase Database uses the election_blacklist_interval configuration item to implement a blacklist feature. If a leader replica stops acting as the leader, from the moment when it becomes a follower, it would not be re-elected as the leader again within the time period specified by election_blacklist_interval. That is, that replica is added to the election blacklist. 
**Notice**



The leader replica is added to the blacklist only when it stops acting as the leader and the observer process is not restarted. After the observer process restarts, the leader replica is not in the blacklist anymore.
