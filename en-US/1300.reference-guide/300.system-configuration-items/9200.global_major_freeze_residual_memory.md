global_major_freeze_residual_memory 
========================================================

global_major_freeze_residual_memory specifies the remaining memory for triggering a global freeze. When the available memory is less than this threshold, a global freeze is triggered.

The value of global_major_freeze_residual_memory is in percentage with memory_limit - system_memory as the base. To be specific, the base is the total memory minus the memory reserved for internal system tenant 500. After the data of a frozen memstore is merged, the occupied memory can be released. Therefore, the memory occupied by the frozen memstore is considered as memory available for the active_memstore, and the memory that the blockcache can occupy is also considered as memory available to the memstore. 
**Note**



The value of global_major_freeze_residual_memory must be greater than the value of global_write_halt_residual_memory. Otherwise, the global freeze trigger will not take effect, and a global freeze can be triggered only by tenants.
