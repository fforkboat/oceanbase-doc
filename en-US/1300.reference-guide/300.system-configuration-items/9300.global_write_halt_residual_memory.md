global_write_halt_residual_memory 
======================================================

global_write_halt_residual_memory specifies the global available memory threshold that triggers the suspension of write operations of common tenants. (System tenants are not affected). That is, when the global available memory is smaller than the configured percentage, common tenants are no longer allowed to write data to the memory, while write operations of the system tenants are not affected.

The value of global_write_halt_residual_memory is in percentage with memory_limit - system_memory as the base. To be specific, the base is the total memory minus the memory reserved for internal system tenant 500. During the calculation of the available memory, the memory that the blockcache can occupy is considered as memory available to the memstore.
