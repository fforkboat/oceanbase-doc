**Notice**

This section describes how to create a PR for the `master` branch. The steps for creating PRs for other branches are similar.

**Step 1: Fork the project repository** 

1. Go to the repository of OceanBase Database on [GitHub](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase).

   

2. Click Fork in the upper-right corner to create a remote branch of this repository.

   




**Step 2: Clone the repository to your device** 

1. Specify a working directory 

   ```bash
   # Specify a working directory.
   working_dir=$HOME/Workspace
   ```

   

2. Specify your account on GitHub. 

   ```bash
   user={GitHub account}
   ```

   

3. Clone the code 

   ```bash
   # Clone the code.
   mkdir -p $working_dir
   cd $working_dir
   git clone git@github.com:$user/oceanbase.git
   # Equivalent command: git clone https://github.com/$user/oceanbase.git
   
   # Add the upstream branch.
   cd $working_dir/oceanbase
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:oceanbase/oceanbase.git
   # Equivalent command: git remote add upstream https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase.git
   
   # Set no_push for the upstream branch.
   git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
   
   # Verify that the remote branch is valid.
   git remote -v
   ```

   




**Step 3: Create a branch** 

1. Update the local `master` branch. 

   ```bash
   cd $working_dir/oceanbase
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout master
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

   

2. Create a branch based on the local `master` branch. 

   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-branch-name
   ```

   




**Step 4: Development** 

Proceed with your development on the `new-branch-name` and save changes. 

**Step 5: Submit changes** 

```bash
# Check the status of local files.
git status

# Add the file you want to submit.
# If you want to submit all changes, run the `git add` command.
git add <file> ... 
git commit -m "commit-message: update the xx"
```



**Step 6: Keep the development branch synchronized with the upstream branch** 

```bash
# Run the following commands on the development branch.
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```



**Step 7: Push changes to the remote branch** 

```bash
# Run the following command on the development branch.
git push -u origin new-branch-name
```



**Step 8: Generate a PR** 

1. Navigate to the forked repository.

   

2. Click `Compare & pull request` next to the `new-branch-name` branch.
