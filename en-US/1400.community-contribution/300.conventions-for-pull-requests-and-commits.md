Conventions for pull requests and commits 
==============================================================

This topic describes of the message conventions for pull requests (PR) and commits for all OceanBase repositories. You need to comply with the following conventions when you make a commit to an OceanBase repository. 

Commit conventions 
---------------------------------------

                <body> // optional

```



This section describes commit message conventions by referring to [AngularJS commit conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit). 

* `<Type>` indicates the commit type.

  

* `<subject>` briefly describes the commit.

  

* To add more information, add a blank line and describe the details in paragraphs.

PR conventions 
-----------------------------------

To submit a PR, you need to include the details of all changes in a concise title. The description is not necessary for a simple change. However, if your PR involves complex changes, include a brief description. If the PR fixes an issue, associate the PR with the issue. 

**A PR template** 

```bash
What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Why are the changes needed?

Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?

How was this patch tested?
```
