Use Docker to deploy OceanBase Database 
============================================================

You can deploy OceanBase Database in various ways and Docker is a convenient choice. This topic uses the OceanBase Database image for Docker: obce-mini. obce-mini is a low-specification, standalone image of OceanBase Community Edition for research, study, and evaluation purposes. obce-mini is not suitable for production or performance testing scenarios. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

Before deploying the obce-mini image, make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

* Your server has at least two cores and 10 GB of memory.

  

* You have installed the latest version of Docker. For more information, see the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

  

* You have started the Docker service on your server.

  




Start an OceanBase Database instance 
---------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to start an OceanBase Database instance:

```unknow
docker run -p 2881:2881 --name some-obce -d oceanbase/obce-mini
```



The process is expected to take two to five minutes. Run the following commands. If `boot success!` is returned, the instance is started. 

```unknow
$ docker logs some-obce | tail -1
boot success!
```



Connect to the OceanBase Database instance 
---------------------------------------------------------------

The obce-mini image is integrated with the OceanBase Database Client (OBClient) and the default connection script ob-mysql. 

```unknow
docker exec -it some-obce ob-mysql sys # Connect to the sys tenant.
docker exec -it some-obce ob-mysql root # Connect to the root account of the user tenant.
docker exec -it some-obce ob-mysql test # Connect to the test account of the user tenant.
```



You can also run the following command to connect to the instance by using the OBClient or MySQL client on your local server. 

```unknow
$mysql -uroot -h127.1 -P2881
```



After the connection is established, the following content is displayed:

```unknow
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 167310
Server version: 5.7.25 OceanBase 3.1.1 (r-00672c3c730c3df6eef3b359eae548d8c2db5ea2) (Built Jun 22 2021 12:46:28)

| OB_MYSQL_PORT    | 2881          | The protocol port number used by the OceanBase Database instance to access the MySQL service.                      |
| OB_RPC_PORT      | 2882          | The RPC communication port of the OceanBase Database instance.                                                     |
| OB_ROOT_PASSWORD | empty         | The password of the sys tenant of the OceanBase Database instance.                                                 |
| OB_CLUSTER_NAME  | mini-ce       | The name of the OceanBase Database instance. OceanBase Database Deployer (OBD) uses this name as the cluster name. |
| OB_TENANT_NAME   | test          | The name of the user tenant that is initialized by default for the OceanBase Database instance.                    |



Run the Sysbench script 
--------------------------------------------

The obce-mini image is integrated with the Sysbench utility in simple configurations. You can run the following commands in sequence to run the Sysbench script with the default configurations. 

```unknow
docker exec -it some-obce sysbench cleanup # Clear data.
docker exec -it some-obce sysbench prepare # Prepare data.
docker exec -it some-obce sysbench run # Run the sysbench benchmark.

docker exec -it some-obce sysbench # Run the above three commands in sequence.
```
