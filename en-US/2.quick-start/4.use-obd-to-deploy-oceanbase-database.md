Use OBD to deploy OceanBase Database 
=========================================================

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Deployer (OBD) to deploy OceanBase Database. 

Glossary 
-----------------------------

* Central control server

  The server that stores the installation package and cluster configuration information of OceanBase Database.
  

* Target server

  The server where you want to install OceanBase Database.
  




Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

Before you connect to OceanBase Database, make sure that the following prerequisites are satisfied:

* You have installed OBD on the central control server. For more information, see [Install OBD](../2.quick-start/3.install-obd.md).

  

* You have installed OceanBase Database on the target server.

  

* You have installed OceanBase Client (OBClient) on the central control server. For more information, see [OBClient Documentation](https://github.com/oceanbase/obclient/blob/master/README.md).

  




Modify the configuration file 
--------------------------------------------------

1. Download the corresponding template from GitHub. 

   In local installation mode where you install OceanBase Database on your central control server, download the [local installation configuration file](https://github.com/oceanbase/obdeploy/blob/master/example/mini-local-example.yaml). 

   In standalone installation mode where you install OceanBase Database on a standalone server other than the central control server, download the [standalone installation configuration file](https://github.com/oceanbase/obdeploy/blob/master/example/mini-single-example.yaml). 

   In distributed installation mode where you install OceanBase Database on multiple servers other than the central control server, download the [distributed installation configuration file](https://github.com/oceanbase/obdeploy/blob/master/example/mini-distributed-example.yaml). 
   **Notice**

   

   The following example describes how to modify the configuration file in local installation mode You must select the configuration template that corresponds to your installation mode.
   

2. Enter your username and password at the beginning of the configuration file. 

   ```yaml
   user:
   username: <Enter your username>
   password: <Enter your password>
   key_file: <Enter your ssh-key file path>
   ```

   

   `username` specifies the username used to log on to the target server. Make sure that your username has access to `home_path`. 
   **Notice**

   

   Generally, you can use only the password or the private key to log on.
   

3. Modify the IP address in the configuration file. 

   ```yaml
   oceanbase-ce:
     servers:
       - name: z1
         # Please don't use hostname, only IP can be supported
         ip: 10.xxx.xx.01
   ```

   

4. Modify the `devname` and `home_path` variables in the configuration file. 

   ```yaml
   oceanbase-ce:
     global:
       home_path: <your_observer_work_path>
       # Please set devname as the network adaptor's name whose ip is in the setting of severs.
       # if set severs as "127.0.0.1", please set devname as "lo"
       # if current ip is 192.168.1.10, and the ip's network adaptor's name is "eth0", please use "eth0"
       devname: bond0
   ```

   
   **Notice**

   You must have access to `home_path`.
   




Start OceanBase Database 
---------------------------------------------

1. Run the following command to deploy the cluster:

   ```bash
   obd cluster deploy <deploy_name> -c <deploy_config_path>
   ```

   

   The parameter `deploy_name` is the deployment configuration name or the configuration file name. The deployment configuration name must be unique.
   

2. Run the following command to start the cluster:

   ```bash
   obd cluster start <deploy_name> 
   ```

   

3. Run the following command to check the cluster status:

   ```bash
   obd cluster display <deploy_name>
   ```

   




Connect to OceanBase Database 
--------------------------------------------------

Perform the following steps to connect to the OceanBase database:

1. Install the OceanBase database client OBClient:

   If you have added the OceanBase official YUM repository as your OceanBase software source, run the following command to install OBClient:

   ```unknow
   sudo yum install -y obclient
   ```

   

   If not, get the offline installation packages on your machine and run the following command to install OBClient:

   ```unknow
   sudo yum install -y libobclient-2.0.0-2.el7.x86_64.rpm
   sudo yum install -y obclient-2.0.0-2.el7.x86_64.rpm
   ```

   
   **Notice**

   

   First, you must download the LibOBClient dependency package of OBClient. The packages used in the sample command may not be the latest. We recommend that you download the latest versions. For more information, see [Download Center](https://open.oceanbase.com/softwareCenter/community).
   

2. Run the following command to use OBClient to connect to OceanBase Database:

   ```unknow
   obclient -h<your_ip> -P<observer_mysql_port> -uroot
   ```

   

   `your_ip` is the IP address of the server that hosts your OceanBase instance. By default, `observer` uses the port `2881` to connect to OBClient. Use the actual port number if you have changed it. 

   The following information indicates successful connection:

   ```unknow
   Welcome to the OceanBase.  Commands end with ; or \g.
   Your OceanBase connection id is 3221503857
   Server version: 5.7.25 OceanBase 3.1.1 (r1-) (Built Apr  7 2021 08:14:49)

   Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.
   
   obclient [(none)]>
   ```

   
   




Verify the cluster (optional) 
--------------------------------------------------

Connect to OceanBase Database and run the following command to verify the cluster:

```sql
MySQL [oceanbase]> USE oceanbase; 
MySQL [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM __all_server;
```



The following information indicates successful cluster deployment:

```sql
