# Connect a C application to OceanBase Database

This topic describes how to connect a C application to OceanBase Database. 

## Prerequisites

Before you install OceanBase Connector/C, make sure that you have set up the basic database development environment that meets the following requirements:

* The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version is 3.4.6 or later. Version 4.8.5 is recommended. 

* The CMake version is 2.8.12 or later.

## Install OceanBase Connector/C

### Install Linux

Obtain the RPM packages of OBClient and OceanBase Connector/C, which is also known as `libobclient`. 

You need to visit the image repository and find the installation packages based on your system version. For more information, see [Software and hardware requirements](../../400.installation-and-deployment/200.local-deployment/100.requirements-for-software-and-hardware.md).

1. Install `libobclient`. 

   ```c
   sudo rpm -ivh libobclient-xx.x86_64.rpm
   ```

2. Install OBClient. 

   ```c
   sudo rpm -ivh obclient-xx.x86_64.rpm
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > OBClient depends on `libobclient`. Therefore, you must install `libobclient` first. 

### Compile OBClient from source code

OceanBase Database provides the source code of the latest [OBClient](https://github.com/oceanbase/obclient) in its repository on Github, which also includes the repository of `libobclient`. 

1. Install the dependency tool. 

   ```c
   sudo yum install -y git cmake gcc make openssl-devel ncurses-devel rpm-build  gcc-c++ bison bison-devel zlib-devel gnutls-devel libxml2-devel openssl-devel \
   libevent-devel libaio-devel
   ```

2. Compile and package the code.

   1. Download the source code of [OBClient](https://github.com/oceanbase/obclient), which also includes sub-repositories. 

      ```bash
      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/oceanbase/obclient #Download the source code of OBClient, which also includes sub-repositories.
      cd obclient
      ```

   2. Compile the script of `libobclient`. 

      ```bash
      cd obclient/libmariadb
      sh build.sh
      ```

   3. Compress the `libobclient` program in an RPM package. 

      ```bash
      cd rpm
      sh libobclient-build.sh
      ```

   4. Compile the script of OBClient. 

      ```bash
      cd ../..  # Return to the obclient directory
      sh build.sh
      ````

   5. Compress the OBClient program in an RPM package. 

      ```bash
      cd rpm
      sh obclient-build.sh
      ```

3. Install `libobclient` and OBClient. 

   ```bash
   cd /obclient/libmariadb/rpm
   sudo rpm -ivh libobclient-xx.x86_64.rpm
   cd ../../rpm # Access the obclient/rpm directory.
   sudo rpm -ivh obclient-xx.x86_64.rpm
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > OBClient depends on `libobclient`. Therefore, you must install `libobclient` first. 

## Examples

The basic methods for an application to interact with an OBServer by using OceanBase Connector/C include:

1. Call `mysql_library_init()` to initialize the MySQL library. 

   ```c
   mysql_library_init(0, NULL, NULL);
   ```

2. Call `mysql_init()` to initialize a connection handle. 

   ```c
   MYSQL *mysql = mysql_init(NULL);
   ```

3. Call `mysql_real_connect()` to connect to the OBServer. 

   ```c
   mysql_real_connect (mysql, host_name, user_name, password,
   db_name, port_num, socket_name, CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS)
   ```

4. Call `mysql_real_query()` or `mysql_query()` to send an SQL statement to the OBServer. 

   ```c
   mysql_query(mysql,"sql_statement");
   ```

5. Call `mysql_store_result()` or `mysql_use_result()` to process the result. 

   ```c
   result=mysql_store_result(mysql);
   ```

6. Call `mysql_free_result()` to release the memory. 

   ```c
   mysql_free_result(result);
   ```

7. Call `mysql_close()` to disconnect from the OBServer. 

   ```c
   mysql_close(mysql);
   ```

8. Call `mysql_library_end()` to stop using `libobclient`. 

   ```c
   mysql_library_end();
   ```

### Sample code

The following sample code uses the `mysql_test.c` file as an example:

```c
#include "mysql.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  mysql_library_init(0, NULL, NULL);
  MYSQL *mysql = mysql_init(NULL);
  char* host_name = "172.xx.xx.xx";//set your mysql host
  char* user_name = "r***"; //set your user_name
  char* password = "******"; //set your password
  char* db_name = "test"; //set your databasename
  int port_num = 2883; //set your mysql port
  char* socket_name = NULL;
  MYSQL_RES* result;
  int status = 0;
  /* connect to server with the CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS option */
  if (mysql_real_connect (mysql, host_name, user_name, password,
    db_name, port_num, socket_name, CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS) == NULL)
  {
    printf("mysql_real_connect() failed\n");
    mysql_close(mysql);
    exit(1);
  }

  /* execute multiple statements */
  status = mysql_query(mysql,
                     "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table;\
                      CREATE TABLE test_table(id INT);\
                      INSERT INTO test_table VALUES(10);\
                      UPDATE test_table SET id=20 WHERE id=10;\
                      SELECT * FROM test_table;\
                      DROP TABLE test_table");
  if (status)
  {
    printf("Could not execute statement(s)");
    mysql_close(mysql);
    exit(0);
  }

 /* process each statement result */
 do {
   /* did current statement return data? */
   result = mysql_store_result(mysql);
   if (result)
   {
     /* yes; process rows and free the result set */
     //process_result_set(mysql, result);
     mysql_free_result(result);
   }
   else          /* no result set or error */
   {
     if (mysql_field_count(mysql) == 0)
     {
       printf("%lld rows affected\n",
            mysql_affected_rows(mysql));
     }
     else  /* some error occurred */
     {
       printf("Could not retrieve result set\n");
       break;
     }
  }
  /* more results? -1 = no, >0 = error, 0 = yes (keep looping) */
  if ((status = mysql_next_result(mysql)) > 0)
    printf("Could not execute statement\n");
  } while (status == 0);

  mysql_close(mysql);
}
```

Parameters

* **hostname**: the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database, which is usually the IP address of an OBProxy. 

* **username**: the connection account of the tenant. By default, the username of the tenant administrator is `root`. 

* **password**: the password of the connection account. 

* **dbname**: the name of the database to be connected. 

* **port**: the port for connecting to OceanBase Database, which is also the listening port of the OBProxy. Default value: 2883, which can be customized. 

After you edit the code, run the following command to compile and execute the file:

```c
//Compile the file.
g++ -I/u01/obclient/include/ -L/u01/obclient/lib -lobclnt mysql_test.c -o mysql_test
//Specify the execution path.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/u01/obclient/lib
//Run the file.
./mysql_test
```

> **Note**
>
> By default, OBClient is installed in the `/u01/obclient` directory.
