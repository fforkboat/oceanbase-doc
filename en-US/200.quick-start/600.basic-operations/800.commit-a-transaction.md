Commit a transaction 
=========================================

Use the `COMMIT` statement to commit a transaction. 

Before you `commit` a transaction:

* Your modifications are visible only to the current session and invisible to other database sessions.

  

* Your modifications are not persistent. You can use the `ROLLBACK` statement to undo them.

  




After you `commit` a transaction:

* Your changes are visible to all database sessions.

  

* Your modifications are persisted into the database. You cannot use the `ROLLBACK` statement to undo them.

  




Example:



```sql
obclient> INSERT INTO t_insert(id,name) VALUES(4,'JP');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> exit;
Bye

[user@host  ~]$obclient -h10.10.10.1 -u******@obbmsql#obdemo -P2883 -p**1*** TPCC
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
