Roll back a transaction 
============================================

Use the `ROLLBACK` statement to roll back a transaction. 

A transaction rollback reverses all changes made in the transaction. You can roll back an entire uncommitted transaction or roll back a transaction to any savepoints of the transaction. To roll back to a specific savepoint, you must use both the `ROLLBACK` and `TO SAVEPOINT` statements. 

Notes:

* If you roll back an entire transaction:

  * The transaction will end.

    
  
  * All modifications made from the start of the transaction will be discarded.

    
  
  * All savepoints will be cleared.

    
  
  * All locks held by the transaction will be released.

    
  

  

* If you roll back a transaction to a specific savepoint:

  * The transaction will not end.

    
  
  * Modifications made before the savepoint will be retained but those made after it will be discarded.

    
  
  * All savepoints after the specific savepoint will be cleared.

    
  
  * All locks held by the transaction after the specific savepoint will be released.
