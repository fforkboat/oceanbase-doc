# Quick start with OceanBase Database

You can deploy OceanBase Database on a physical server or VM with the x86_64 or ARM_64 architecture.  You can deploy a single-replica OceanBase cluster and add nodes to the cluster. This topic describes how to install a single-replica OceanBase cluster on a regular physical server by using RPM packages.

For more information about deploying an OceanBase cluster, see [Deployment introduction](../400.deploy-the-oceanbase-database/100.deployment-introduction.md).

## Prepare the server and media

1. Requirements on the server architecture and version of Linux operating systems

   The following table describes the Linux operating systems that support OceanBase Database.

   |             Linux operating system         |    Version     | Server architecture|

   |obclient-*.rpm|1.2.6|The RPM file of OBClient. OBClient is required for connecting to Oracle instances. |

   > **Note**
   >
   > To download the installation package, go to the official website of OceanBase Database, and then click [Download](https://www.oceanbase.com/softwareCenter) in the upper-right corner of the homepage to go to the Software Center page.

4. Disk planning

   By default, `/data/1` is used as the data directory, `/data/log1` as the log directory, and `/home` as the installation directory of OceanBase Database.

## Procedure

1. Copy the RPM packages of OceanBase Antman Edition, OceanBase Database V4.0, and OBClient to the server where OceanBase Database V4.0 is to be installed.

2. Install OceanBase Antman Edition.

   Log on to the server as the root user and run the following command to install OceanBase Antman Edition:

   ```shell
   [root@hostname /]# rpm -ivh t-oceanbase-antman-x.x.x-xxxxxxxxxxxx.alios7.x86_64.rpm
   ```

   For more information about how to install OceanBase Antman Edition, see [Install OAT-CLI](../400.deploy-the-oceanbase-database/600.command-line-deployment/100.configure-a-deployment-environment-2/100.install-oat-cli.md).

3. Add the admin user.

   The observer process runs under the admin user. The owner of the related directories must be the admin user.

   ```shell
   [root@hostname /]# cd /root/t-oceanbase-antman/clonescripts
   [root@hostname clonescripts]# ./clone.sh -u
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > If the admin user group and admin user already exist but the GID or UID is not 500, we recommend that you delete the admin user group and admin user and create them again by using the preceding script.

4. Modify the kernel configurations of the operating system.

   Run the following commands to configure each OBServer:

   ```shell
   [root@hostname /]# cd /root/t-oceanbase-antman/clonescripts
   [root@hostname clonescripts]# ./clone.sh -c -r ob
   ```

5. Install dependencies.

   Run the following commands on each OBServer to install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   [root@hostname /]# cd /root/t-oceanbase-antman/clonescripts
   [root@hostname clonescripts]# ./clone.sh -m -r ob
   ```

6. Install the RPM package of OceanBase Database.

   Example:

   ```shell
   [root@hostname /]# rpm -ivh oceanbase-4.0.0.0-100000152022092610.el7.x86_64.rpm
   Preparing...                          ################################# [100%]
   Updating / installing...
   1:oceanbase-4.0.0.0-100000152022092################################# [100%]
   ```

7. Install OBClient.

   OBClient is a CLI client of OceanBase Database. You can use it to access MySQL and Oracle tenants of OceanBase Database.

   Example:

   ```shell
   [root@hostname /]# rpm -ivh obclient-1.2.6-20210510164331.el7.alios7.x86_64.rpm
   Preparing...                          ################################# [100%]
   Updating / installing...
   1:obclient-1.2.6-20210510164331.el7################################# [100%]
   ```

   Run the following command to check whether OBClient is successfully installed:

   ```shell
   [root@hostname /]# which obclient
   /usr/bin/obclient
   ```

8. Initialize the directories of OceanBase Database.

   We recommend that you specify the data directory of OceanBase Database to an independent disk and link this directory to the home directory of OceanBase Database by using a soft link. `$cluster_name` indicates the cluster name.

   Switch to the admin user.

   ```shell
   [root@hostname /]# su - admin
   ```

   Initialize the directories of OceanBase Database.

   ```shell
   -bash-4.2$ mkdir -p /data/1/$cluster_name/{etc3,sort_dir,sstable,slog}
   -bash-4.2$ mkdir -p /data/log1/$cluster_name/{clog,etc2,ilog,oob_clog}
   -bash-4.2$ mkdir -p /home/admin/oceanbase/store/$cluster_name
   -bash-4.2$ for t in {etc3,sort_dir,sstable,slog};do ln -s /data/1/$cluster_name/$t /home/admin/oceanbase/store/$cluster_name/$t; done
   -bash-4.2$ for t in {clog,etc2,ilog,oob_clog};do ln -s /data/log1/$cluster_name/$t /home/admin/oceanbase/store/$cluster_name/$t; done
   ```

   In the following sample code, the cluster name is `obdemo`.

   ```shell
   -bash-4.2$ mkdir -p /data/1/obdemo/{etc3,sort_dir,sstable,slog}
   -bash-4.2$ mkdir -p /data/log1/obdemo/{clog,etc2,ilog,oob_clog}
   -bash-4.2$ mkdir -p /home/admin/oceanbase/store/obdemo
   -bash-4.2$ for t in {etc3,sort_dir,sstable,slog};do ln -s /data/1/obdemo/$t /home/admin/oceanbase/store/obdemo/$t; done
   -bash-4.2$ for t in {clog,etc2,ilog,oob_clog};do ln -s /data/log1/obdemo/$t /home/admin/oceanbase/store/obdemo/$t; done
   ```

9. Start the observer process.

   Examples:

   > **Note**
   >
   > The IP address in the sample code is for reference only. You must enter the actual IP address of your server during deployment.

   Switch to the admin user.

   ```shell
   [root@hostname /]# su - admin
   ```

   Start the observer process.

   ```shell
   -bash-4.2$ cd /home/admin/oceanbase && /home/admin/oceanbase/bin/observer -i eth0 -P 2882 -p 2881 -z zone1 -d /home/admin/oceanbase/store/obdemo -r '10.10.10.1:2882:2881' -c 10001 -n obdemo -o "system_memory=16G,datafile_size=100G,config_additional_dir=/data/1/obdemo/etc3;/data/log1/obdemo/etc2"
   -bash-4.2$ sleep 5
   -bash-4.2$ ps -ef|grep observer
   ```

10. Perform the bootstrap operation on the cluster.

   > **Note**
   >
   > * The IP address in the sample code is for reference only. You must enter the actual IP address of your server during deployment.
   > * Run the following OBClient command to connect to the started observer process. 

   ```sql
   [root@hostname /]# obclient -h127.0.0.1 -uroot@sys -P2881 -p
   Enter password:

   obclient> SET SESSION ob_query_timeout=1000000000;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM BOOTSTRAP ZONE 'zone1' SERVER '10.10.10.1:2882';
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

11. Verify whether the cluster is successfully initialized.

   After you perform the bootstrap operation, run the `SHOW DATABASES;` command. If oceanbase appears in the database list, the cluster is successfully initialized.

   ```sql
   obclient> SHOW DATABASES;
   +--------------------+
   | Database           |
   +--------------------+
   | oceanbase          |
   | information_schema |
   | mysql              |
   | SYS                |
   | LBACSYS            |
   | ORAAUDITOR         |
   | test               |
   +--------------------+
   7 rows in set
   ```

## Create a user tenant

After you deploy an OceanBase cluster, the sys tenant is automatically created in the database by default. Then, you can create user tenants in the sys tenant as needed.

For more information about how to create a user tenant, see [Create a tenant](../400.deploy-the-oceanbase-database/600.command-line-deployment/500.create-an-oceanbase-tenant-2/200.create-a-tenant-2.md).
