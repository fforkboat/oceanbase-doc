# Connect Python applications to OceanBase Database

This topic describes how to connect to OceanBase Database by using Python drivers.

## Use PyMySQL in a Python 3.x environment

If you use Python 3.x, you can connect to a MySQL database server by using PyMySQL.

PyMySQL implements Python Database API Specification 2.0 and contains a pure-Python MySQL client library.

For more information about PyMySQL, see [PyMySQL documentation](https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/) and [API Reference](https://pymysql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/index.html).

### Install PyMySQL

You must install PyMySQL before you can use it. To download the installation package, click [here](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL).

You can install PyMySQL by using one of the following two methods:

1. Run the following command in a CLI tool:

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install PyMySQL
   ```

2. Compile the source code

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL
   cd PyMySQL/
   python3 setup.py install
   ```

### Use PyMySQL

You can run the following command to set the object to connect:

```bash
conn = pymysql.connect(
    host="localhost",
    port=2881,user="root",
    passwd="",
    db="testdb"
)
```

Example:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import pymysql

conn = pymysql.connect(host="localhost", port=2881,
                       user="root", passwd="", db="testdb")

try:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute('SELECT * FROM cities')
        ans = cur.fetchall()
        print(ans)

finally:
    conn.close()
```

## Use MySQL-python in a Python 2.x environment

If you use Python 2.x, you can connect to a MySQL database server by using MySQL-python.

MySQL-python allows you to connect to and operate on an OceanBase database by using MySQLdb. MySQLdb is an interface that allows you to connect a Python application to a MySQL database. It implements the Python Database API Specification 2.0 and is built based on the MySQL C API.

For more information about MySQL-python, see [MySQL-python documentation](https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python/) and the [Project description on Github](https://github.com/farcepest/MySQLdb1).

### Install MySQL-python

Before you use pip to install MySQL-python, ensure that Python 2.x is installed on your computer.

```bash
pip install MySQL-python
```

### Use MySQL-python

You can run the following command to set the object to connect:

```bash
conn= MySQLdb.connect(
    host='127.0.0.1',
    port = 2881,
    user='root',
    passwd='',
    db ='testdb'
)    
```

Example:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python2

import MySQLdb

conn= MySQLdb.connect(
    host='127.0.0.1',
    port = 2881,
    user='root',
    passwd='',
    db ='testdb'
)

try:
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute('SELECT * from cities')
    ans = cur.fetchall()
    print(ans)

finally:
    conn.close()
```
