# Connect Java applications to OceanBase Database

This topic describes how to connect Java applications to OceanBase Database.

## Prerequisites

* A basic database development environment is deployed.

* You have installed or upgraded to JDK 8 on your computer.

* You have obtained the installation package of the OceanBase Connector/J driver from OceanBase Technical Support.

## Procedure

1. Place the JAR package of OceanBase Connector/J in the local `/usr/share/java` path and set the temporary environment variables.

   ```shell
   mv ./oceanbase-client-{version}.jar /usr/share/java
   export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/oceanbase-client-{version}.jar:$CLASSPATH
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > Perform the preceding operations based on the downloaded file version.

2. Compile the Java file `HelloWorld.java`.

   ```java
   import java.sql.Connection;
   import java.sql.DriverManager;
   import java.sql.SQLException;

   public class HelloWorld {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           try {
               String url = "jdbc:oceanbase://172.30.xx.xx:2881/?pool=false";
               String  user = "s**@oracle";
               String  password = "***1**";
               Class.forName("com.oceanbase.jdbc.Driver");
               Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
               System.out.println(connection.getAutoCommit());
           }catch (SQLException ex) {
                       System.out.println("error!");
                       ex.printStackTrace() ;
           }catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
                       e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Parameters

   * **url**: `jdbc:oceanbase://IP:port/?pool=false`. Specifies the IP address and port for connecting to OceanBase Database, which is usually the IP address of an OBProxy.

   * **user**: the username for connecting to the tenant, in the `username@tenant name` format. In Oracle mode, the default username of the administrator is `SYS`.

      > **Note**
      >
      > In a private cloud or standalone deployment scenario, the format of the `username` is `String username` = "username@tenant#cluster".

   * **password**: specifies the password of the account.

3. After you edit the code, you can run the following commands to compile and run the code. If true is returned, you have connected to the database.

   ```java
   // Compile the code.
   javac Test.java
   // Run the code.
   java Test
   ```
