# Connect to OceanBase Database by using ODC

You can connect to OceanBase Database by using OceanBase Developer Center (ODC). 

## Prerequisites

* You have installed ODC. 

   To download the ODC installation package of a suitable version, visit [Software Center](https://open.oceanbase.com/softwareCenter/community). For more information about how to install ODC, see [Install ODC](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/community/odc-cn/V3.2.2/10000000000014266). 

* You have obtained the OceanBase Database connection string from the deployment engineers. 

   Information in the connection string is required when you connect to the database by using ODC. 

## Usage notes

When you connect to OceanBase Database by using ODC, you can connect only to the database in the current tenant. 

## Procedure

> **Note**
>
> The graphic user interface (GUI) varies with the ODC version. This topic takes ODC V3.2.0 as an example. For other ODC versions, see the ODC User Guide of the corresponding version. 

1. Log on to ODC. 

   The ODC homepage appears, and the **Private Connection** tab is displayed on the ODC homepage. 

2. In the upper-right corner of the **Private Connection** tab, click **Create Connection**. 

   ![Create a database connection](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer/V3.1.3/zh-CN/developer-guide/connect-to-oceanbase-database/4.%E6%96%B0%E5%BB%BA%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93%E8%BF%9E%E6%8E%A5.png)

   > **Note**
   >
   > It takes some time to load the data when you run ODC the first time. 

3. On the page that appears, specify the information about the database to be connected.

   You can specify basic configurations of a database connection in two ways:

   * Specify the information described in the following table based on the OceanBase Database connection string: `mysql -h host name -P port number -u database username@tenant name#cluster name -D default database -p database password`. 

   * Copy the connection string to the **Intelligent Parsing** field. ODC automatically recognizes the connection string and populates the connection information. 

   | Item | Description |
   |-------------|-------------------------------------------|
   | Region | Select **Public Cloud** if your database instance is deployed on Alibaba Cloud, or select **Independent Deployment/Apsara Stack** if your database instance is deployed in your own environment.  |
   | Connection Mode | Select **MySQL**.  |
   | Connection Name | Specify the name of the connection.  |
   | Set Tag | Add a description for the connection.  Click the **Set Tag** button after **Connection Name** to set a tag for the current connection. You can set and manage tags in the drop-down list that appears. <ul><li>Tag setting: Select a tag from the drop-down list. Create tags first if the list is empty. <li> Tag management: Click **Create Tag** at the bottom of the list or the settings icon above the list to pop up the **Tags** window. In the Tags window, you can edit or delete created tags. You can also click the **Create Tag** button to set a name or color for the new tag. </li></ul> |
   | Endpoint | <ul><li>**Host Name**: the IP address of the server where the target database is located. </li><li> **Port**: the port number of the server where the target database is located. </li> <li>**Cluster**: the name of the cluster where the target database is located. </li><li> **Tenant**: the name of the tenant in which the target database is located. </li></ul> |
   | Default Database | When you connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, you must specify the default database for the connection.  |
   | Database Username | An account in the tenant. In MySQL mode, this account must have the permission to access the default database.  |
   | Database Password | The password of the account in the tenant.  You can click the **Test Connection** button after the password box to test whether you can connect to the target database. An error is returned if the configuration information such as the username, password, or network configuration is invalid.  |
   | Save Database Password | If you disable this option, the database password for the connection is not saved. Each time you use or test a connection, you must enter the database password in the password dialog box to use the connection.  If you enable this option, the database password for the connection is saved. You do not need to enter the database password each time you use the connection.  |
   | Intelligent Parsing | You can paste a connection string to the field. ODC automatically identifies the string and fills in the corresponding fields on the page.  |
   | SQL Query Timeout Value | This option appears after you click **Advanced Configuration**. You can specify a timeout value for SQL queries. A query whose execution time exceeds the timeout value is automatically terminated. The default timeout value is 60 seconds.  |
   | Query sys Tenant View | This option appears after you click **Advanced Configuration**. When **Tenant** under **Endpoint** is set to `sys`, this option is automatically populated. <ul><li> **Account**: an account having the privilege to check the views under the `sys` tenant. </li><li> **Password**: the password of the account. After you specify the account and password, you can click **Test Connection** next to the password field to verify whether the account information is valid. </li></ul> <blockquote>**Note**</br>In ODC V2.3.0 and later versions, to use the import and export features and check the partition information, you must configure the `root@sys` account in this field. </blockquote> |

4. Click **Save** to save the current configuration in the ODC connection list. 

5. In the connection list, click the name of the connection that you saved or click **Open** in the **Actions** column to log on to OceanBase Database.
