# Create a view

This topic describes how to create a normal view.

## Syntax

You can use the CREATE VIEW statement to create a view.

```sql
create_view_stmt:
  CREATE [OR REPLACE] VIEW view_name [(column_name_list)] AS select_stmt;

column_name_list:
    column_name [, column_name ...]
```

### Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| OR REPLACE | Specifies to re-create a view that already exists by using a new definition.  |
| view_name | Specifies the name of the view. The name must be unique in the database and cannot be the same as that of another table or view.  |
| select_stmt | Specifies the `SELECT` statement used to create the view, which defines the view. The statement can query multiple base tables or source views.  |
| column_name_list | The column names in the view, which must be unique, like those in a base table. By default, the column names retrieved by the `SELECT` statement are used as the column names in the view. You can also use the optional `column_name_list` clause to define column names for a view. Separate multiple column names with commas (,). The number of column names in `column_name_list` must be equal to the number of columns retrieved by the `SELECT` statement. The `SELECT` statement can directly reference the columns of a table. You can also use functions, constants, and operators in the statement to retrieve columns.  |

## Examples

Create an associated query view named `v` based on the `t1` and `t2` tables.

1. Create a table named `t1`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t1 (id1 int,name varchar(256),sex varchar(256));
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. Create a LIST COLUMNS-partitioned table named `t2`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t2 (id2 int,age int,date date);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. Create a view named `v`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE VIEW v
                     AS
                     SELECT
                     id1 as id,name, date, age, sex
                     FROM t1 a, t2 b
                     WHERE a.id1 = b.id2;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

4. Show the description of the `v` view.

   ```sql
   obclient> DESC v;
   +-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   | Field | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
   +-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   | id    | int(11)      | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
   | name  | varchar(256) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
   | date  | date         | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
   | age   | int(11)      | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
   | sex   | varchar(256) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
   +-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   5 rows in set
   ```
