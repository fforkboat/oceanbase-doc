# About table clearing

OceanBase Database in MySQL mode allows you to clear a table by using the `DELETE` or `TRUNCATE` statement.

## Prerequisites

The current user has the `DELETE` privilege for the target table.

## DELETE statement

### Description

You can use this statement to delete rows that meet the conditions from one or more tables.

### Syntax

```sql
Single-Table-Delete Syntax:
    DELETE [hint_options] FROM tbl_name
    [PARTITION (partition_name,...)]
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [ORDER BY order_expression_list]
    [LIMIT row_count]

Multiple-Table-Delete Syntax:
    DELETE [hint_options] tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[.*]] ...
    FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]
Or:
    DELETE [hint_options] FROM tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[.*]] ...
    USING table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]

where_condition:
    expression

order_expression_list:
    order_expression [, order_expression ...]

order_expression:
    expression [ASC | DESC]

limit_row_count:
    INT_VALUE

table_references:
    {tbl_name | joined_table | table_subquery | select_with_parens} [, ...]

```

### Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| hint_options | The hint options.  |
| tbl_name | The name of the table to be deleted.  |
| partition_name | The name of the partition in the table to be deleted.  |
| where_condition | The filtering condition that must be met for a table to be deleted.  |
| order_expression_list | The list of sort keys for the table to be deleted.  |
| row_count | The number of rows to be deleted from the table. The specified value must be an integer.  |
| table_references | The sequence of tables to be selected when you delete data from two or more tables.  |

### Examples

Clear the data in the `dws_ny` table.

1. Query the data in the `dws_ny` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM dws_ny;
   +----+--------+------------+
   | id | name   | date       |
   +----+--------+------------+
   |  1 | Zhang San   | 0000-00-00 |
   |  2 | Li Si   | 0000-00-00 |
   +----+--------+------------+
   2 rows in set
   ```

2. Clear the data in the `dws_ny` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> DELETE FROM dws_ny;
   Query OK, 2 rows affected
   ```

3. Query the data in the `dws_ny` table again.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM dws_ny;
   Empty set
   ```

## TRUNCATE statement

### Description

You can use this statement to completely clear a specified table but retain the table structure, including the partitions defined in the table. Logically, this statement is equivalent to the `DELETE FROM` statement that is used to delete all rows. To execute the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement, you must have the delete and create permissions for the table. It is a DDL statement.

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement differs from the `DELETE FROM` statement in the following aspects:

* TRUNCATE TABLE deletes a table and recreates one, which is much faster than deleting rows one by one.

* The execution result of the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement shows that 0 rows are affected.

* When you use `TRUNCATE TABLE`, the table management program does not record the last `AUTO_INCREMENT` value, but resets it to zero.

* The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement cannot be executed during transactions or when the table is locked. Otherwise, an error is returned.

* If the table definition file is valid, you can use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to recreate the table as an empty table, even if the data or indexes are corrupted.

### Syntax

```sql
TRUNCATE [TABLE] table_name;
```

### Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|------------|--------|
| table_name | The table name.  |

### Examples

Clear the data in the `t1` table.

1. Query the data in the `t1` table.

   ```sql
   obclient>  SELECT * FROM t1;
   +----+--------+------+
   | id | name   | age  |
   +----+--------+------+
   |  1 | Zhang San   |   22 |
   |  2 | Li Si   |   33 |
   +----+--------+------+
   2 rows in set
   ```

2. Clear the data in the `t1` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> TRUNCATE t1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. Query the data in the `t1` table again.

   ```sql
   obclient>  SELECT * FROM t1;
   Empty set
   ```
