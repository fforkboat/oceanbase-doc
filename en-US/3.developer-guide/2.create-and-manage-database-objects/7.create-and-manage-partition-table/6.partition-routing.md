# Partition routing

Partitioning is a built-in feature of OceanBase Database. You only need to specify the partitioning strategy and the number of partitions when you create a table. This topic describes the background, syntax, and examples of partition routing.

## Background

The SQL queries for a partitioned table are the same as those for a regular table. OBProxy or OBServer of OceanBase automatically routes SQL queries of users to the corresponding nodes. The partitioning details of a partitioned table are transparent to the applications.

## Syntax

If you know the partition number of the data you want to read, you can run SQL queries to directly access the partition in the partitioned table. Basic syntax:

```sql
part_table partition (partition_name)
```

By default, unless you define the partition names, each partition is given a number as its name based on a particular rule. Examples:

* Partition names: p0, p1, p2, ...

* Subpartition names: p0sp0, p0sp1, p0sp2, ..., p1sp0, p1sp1, p1sp2, ...

## Examples

1. Query the `p0` partition.

   ```sql
   obclient> select * from t_log partition(p0);
   +------+---------------------+
   | col1 | col2                |
   +------+---------------------+
   |   10 | 2021-03-30 00:00:00 |
   |   18 | 2021-04-30 00:00:00 |
   |   10 | 2021-07-01 00:00:00 |
   |   11 | 2021-09-30 00:00:00 |
   +------+---------------------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

2. Query the `p0sp1` subpartition.

   ```sql
   obclient> select * from t_log partition(p0sp1);
   +------+---------------------+
   | col1 | col2                |
   +------+---------------------+
   |   18 | 2021-04-30 00:00:00 |
   +------+---------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```
