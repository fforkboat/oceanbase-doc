# ORDER BY queries

The ORDER BY clause sorts query results by one or multiple attribute columns in ascending or descending order. The query results are sorted in ascending order by default.

## Syntax

`ORDER BY` supports sorting by a single field, multiple fields, alias, and function. Separate multiple fields with commas (,). Syntax for the ORDER BY clause:

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM table_list
[WHERE query_condition]
ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC] [,column_name [ASC|DESC]...];
```

## Examples

### Single-field sorting

Display employee information by `deptno` in ascending order.

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp ORDER BY deptno;
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| SMITH   |     20 |
| SCOTT   |     20 |
| ALLEN   |     30 |
| BLAKE   |     30 |
| JONES   |     40 |
| FORD    |     40 |
+---------+--------+
6 rows in set
```

Display employee names by `deptno` in ascending order.

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp ORDER BY deptno DESC;
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| JONES   |     40 |
| FORD    |     40 |
| ALLEN   |     30 |
| BLAKE   |     30 |
| SMITH   |     20 |
| SCOTT   |     20 |
+---------+--------+
6 rows in set
```

### Multiple-field sorting

Display employee information by `deptno` in ascending order and by `sal` in descending order.

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno, sal FROM emp ORDER BY deptno ASC, sal DESC;
+---------+--------+---------+
| empname | deptno | sal     |
+---------+--------+---------+
| SCOTT   |     20 | 3000.00 |
| SMITH   |     20 |  800.00 |
| BLAKE   |     30 | 2850.00 |
| ALLEN   |     30 | 1600.00 |
| FORD    |     40 | 3000.00 |
| JONES   |     40 | 2975.00 |
+---------+--------+---------+
6 rows in set
```

### Sorting by alias

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname 'Employee name', deptno 'Department No.', sal 'Salary' FROM emp ORDER BY Department No.ASC,Salary DESC;
+--------------+--------------+---------+
| Employee name     | Department No.     | Salary    |
+--------------+--------------+---------+
| SCOTT        |           20 | 3000.00 |
| SMITH        |           20 |  800.00 |
| BLAKE        |           30 | 2850.00 |
| ALLEN        |           30 | 1600.00 |
| FORD         |           40 | 3000.00 |
| JONES        |           40 | 2975.00 |
+--------------+--------------+---------+
6 rows in set
```

### Sorting by functions

Use functions in the `ORDER BY` clause for sorting. `YEAR()` is a time function that returns the year part of a date.

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno, YEAR(hiredate) FROM emp ORDER BY deptno ASC, YEAR(hiredate) DESC;
+---------+--------+----------------+
| empname | deptno | YEAR(hiredate) |
+---------+--------+----------------+
| SCOTT   |     20 |           1987 |
| SMITH   |     20 |           1980 |
| ALLEN   |     30 |           1981 |
| BLAKE   |     30 |           1981 |
| JONES   |     40 |           1981 |
| FORD    |     40 |           1981 |
+---------+--------+----------------+
6 rows in set
```

Use aliases in the `ORDER BY` clause for sorting. `YEAR()` is a time function that returns the year part of a date.

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname 'Employee name', deptno 'Department No.',YEAR (hiredate) 'Year of birth' FROM emp ORDER BY deptno ASC,Year of birth DESC;
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| Employee name     | Department No.     | Year of birth     |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| SCOTT        |           20 |         1987 |
| SMITH        |           20 |         1980 |
| ALLEN        |           30 |         1981 |
| BLAKE        |           30 |         1981 |
| JONES        |           40 |         1981 |
| FORD         |           40 |         1981 |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
6 rows in set
```

### Sorting after the WHERE clause

Use the `WHERE` clause to filter data before sorting. Examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno, sal, YEAR(hiredate) FROM emp WHERE sal >= 1000 ORDER BY YEAR(hiredate);
+---------+--------+---------+----------------+
| empname | deptno | sal     | YEAR(hiredate) |
+---------+--------+---------+----------------+
| ALLEN   |     30 | 1600.00 |           1981 |
| JONES   |     40 | 2975.00 |           1981 |
| BLAKE   |     30 | 2850.00 |           1981 |
| FORD    |     40 | 3000.00 |           1981 |
| SCOTT   |     20 | 3000.00 |           1987 |
+---------+--------+---------+----------------+
5 rows in set
```
