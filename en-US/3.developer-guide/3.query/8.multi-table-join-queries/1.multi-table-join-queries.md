# About multi-table join queries

You can add the JOIN… ON clause following the FROM keyword in the SELECT statement to join tables and query data from these tables.

## Syntax

The business of joined tables is associated. For example, some fields are identical in terms of value definition and data. This association is a join condition and can be enclosed in the brackets following the `ON` keyword in the `JOIN… ON` clause. Filter conditions can be also contained in the brackets following the `ON` keyword. Syntax of the SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM table_name1 [INNER|LEFT|RIGHT] JOIN table_name2 ON join_condition
WHERE query_condition
```

## Usage notes

Most join queries contain at least one join condition in the `FROM` or `WHERE` clause. Multi-table join queries can be used with the `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` statements.

The `select_list` clause can select any column from the tables specified in the `FROM` clause. If any two tables have identical column names, the table names must be specified in the entire query to define a reference to these columns.
