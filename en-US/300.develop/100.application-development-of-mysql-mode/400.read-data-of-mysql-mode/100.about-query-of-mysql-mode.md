# About queries

SQL queries are used to obtain data from databases. A query can be used with various clauses, such as conditional clauses (like WHERE) and sort clauses (like ORDER BY), to obtain query results. 

## Syntax

An SQL query is a `SELECT` statement used to query data from one or multiple tables or views. The `SELECT` statement can complete simple single-table queries and complex connection queries and embedded queries. 

Syntax for the simplest SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT <select_list> [ FROM <table_list>]
```

Parameters in the syntax:

* `select_list` specifies the columns, or functions, constants, or variables from the `table_list` that follows. 

* `table_list` specifies the tables or views that contain the data to be retrieved. 

## Considerations

`table_list` can also specify a subquery statement that contains the `WHERE` clause to ensure that the returned result complies with certain conditions. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_a t1 WHERE t1.pk IN (SELECT t2.pk FROM table_b t2);
```

In MySQL mode, the `FROM table_list` clause is optional. Without this clause, `select_list` does not specify a specific column but a constant or variable. Example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT 'Medium', 6*6 ;
+-------+-----+
| Medium| 6*6 |
+-------+-----+
| Medium|  36 |
+-------+-----+
1 row in set
```
