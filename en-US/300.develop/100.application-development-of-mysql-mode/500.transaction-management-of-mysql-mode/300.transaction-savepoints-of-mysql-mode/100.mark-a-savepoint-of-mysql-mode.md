# Mark a savepoint

The `SAVEPOINT` statement marks a savepoint during a transaction. You can roll back a transaction to a savepoint. Savepoints are optional. A transaction can have multiple savepoints. 

## Mark a savepoint

After a transaction is started, you can use the following statement to mark a savepoint: 

```sql
SAVEPOINT pointname;
```

`pointname` specifies the name of the transaction savepoint. 

Example: Start a transaction and mark multiple savepoints. 

```sql
obclient [test]> SET SESSION autocommit=0;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [test]> BEGIN;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [test]> INSERT INTO ordr(id, name) VALUES(6,'FR');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient [test]> SAVEPOINT fr;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [test]> INSERT INTO ordr(id, name) VALUES(7,'RU');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient [test]>  SAVEPOINT ru;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [test]> INSERT INTO ordr(id, name) VALUES(8,'CA');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient [test]> SAVEPOINT ca;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
