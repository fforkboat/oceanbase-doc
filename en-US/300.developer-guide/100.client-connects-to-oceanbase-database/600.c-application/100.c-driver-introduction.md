# OceanBase Connector/C

OceanBase Connector/C is an OBClient development component based on C/C++. OceanBase Connector/C supports C API libraries.

OceanBase Connector/C allows C/C++ applications to access OceanBase distributed database clusters from the underlying layer. Then, the applications can perform operations such as database connection, data access, error processing, and prepared statement processing.

OceanBase Connector/C, also known as `LibOBClient`, is used by applications as an independent server process to communicate with OBServers based on network connections. A client application references the C API header file during compilation and can connect to the C API library file.

> **Note**
>
> The `.so` file generated by `LibobClient` is `libobclnt.so`, which corresponds to the `libmysqlclient.so` file in MySQL. OceanBase Database uses OBClient as its CLI tool, which corresponds to the CLI tool in MySQL.
