# About DDL statements

You can use DDL statements to create, update, and delete database objects. This topic describes the background of and database objects supported by DDL statements.

## Background

OceanBase Database issues an implicit COMMIT statement before and after a DDL statement. Therefore, DDL statements cannot be rolled back.

> **Note**

> * In the CLI environment of OceanBase Client (OBClient), you can enter a DDL statement after the SQL prompt `>`.
> * You can also enter a DDL statement in the ODC SQL Editor window.

## Database objects supported by DDL statements

DDL statements in OceanBase Database support the following database objects:

* Table

   * The constraints and indexes on tables are included.

   * A table is the most basic unit of data storage.

   * Tables contain data that all users can access. Each table contains one or more rows. Each row contains one or more columns.

* Views

   * A view displays the results of a query on the table.

   * You can use views in most cases where you can use tables. If the data you frequently access is distributed across multiple tables, a view is the best choice.

* Custom functions

* Custom types

* Custom triggers

* Custom stored procedures
