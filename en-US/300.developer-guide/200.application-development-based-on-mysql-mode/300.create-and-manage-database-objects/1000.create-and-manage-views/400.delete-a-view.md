# Delete a view

This topic describes how to drop a view.

## Syntax

You can use the DROP VIEW statement to drop one or more views.

> **Note**
>
> To execute this statement, you must have the `DROP` privilege for each view.

```unknow
drop_view_stmt:
    DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] view_name_list [CASCADE | RESTRICT];

view_name_list:
    view_name [, view_name_list]
```

### Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IF EXISTS | The `IF EXISTS` keyword prevents the error that occurs because a view to be dropped does not exist.  |
| view_name_list | If `view_name_list` contains views that do not exist, an error may be reported during execution but the specified views that exist are dropped.  |
| CASCADE \| RESTRICT | `CASCADE` indicates that the objects dependent on the view are automatically removed.  `RESTRICT` indicates that the view cannot be dropped if an object that depends on the view exists.  <blockquote><b>Note</b></br>The current version does not support this parameter. If this parameter is specified, it will be parsed and ignored. </blockquote> |

## Examples

### Example 1

Drop the `v1` view.

```unknow
obclient> DROP VIEW v1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

### Example 2

Drop the `v1` and `v2` views.

```unknow
obclient> DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v1,v2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning
```

> **Note**
>
> * If the `IF EXISTS` keyword is not used and the `v1` view does not exist in the database, neither of the views ``can be dropped
>
>    ```sql
>    obclient> DROP VIEW v1,v2;
>    ERROR 1051 (42S02): Unknown table 'ny.v1'
>    ```
>
> * If the `IF EXISTS` keyword is used, the `v2` view can be dropped even if the `v1` view does not exist in the database.
>
>    ```sql
>    obclient> DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v3,v4;
>    Query OK, 0 rows affected, 2 warnings
>    ```
