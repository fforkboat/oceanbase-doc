# Create a sequence

You can use the `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement to create a sequence. This topic describes how to create a sequence.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE [ schema. ] sequence_name
{ START WITH int_value
|[ INCREMENT BY int_value ]
|[ MINVALUE int_value | NOMINVALUE ]
|[ MAXVALUE int_value | NOMAXVALUE ]  
|[ CACHE int_value | NOCACHE ]
|[ ORDER | NOORDER ]
|[ CYCLE | NOCYCLE ]  
};
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| schema. | The schema where the sequence to be created resides.  If this parameter is not specified, the database creates the sequence in the schema of the current user. SET GLOBALSET GLOBAL |
| sequence_name | The name of the sequence to be created. SET GLOBALSET GLOBAL |
| MINVALUE int_value | The minimum value of the sequence. The value range of `int_value` is \[-9223372036854775808,9223372036854775807\]. SET GLOBALSET GLOBAL |
| NOMINVALUE | `NOMINVALUE` is the default value.  If `NOMINVALUE` is specified, the minimum value is 1 when the sequence ascends, and is -9223372036854775808 when the sequence descends. SET GLOBALSET GLOBAL |
| MAXVALUE int_value | The maximum value of the sequence. The value range of `int_value` is \[-9223372036854775808,9223372036854775807\].  <blockquote><b>Notice</b></br><ul><li>When `MINVALUE` and `MAXVALUE` are both specified, `MINVALUE` must be smaller than `MAXVALUE`. </li><li> The difference between `MAXVALUE` and `MINVALUE` must be greater than or equal to `INCREMENT BY int_value`. </li></ul>  </blockquote> |
| NOMAXVALUE | `NOMAXVALUE` is the default value.  If `NOMAXVALUE` is specified, the maximum value is 9223372036854775807 when the sequence ascends or -1 when the sequence descends. SET GLOBALSET GLOBAL |
| START WITH int_value | The start value of the sequence. `int_value` must be smaller than or equal to `MAXVALUE`, and greater than or equal to `MINVALUE`.  If no start value is specified, the start value is the minimum value for an ascending sequence and the maximum value for a descending sequence. SET GLOBAL |
| INCREMENT BY int_value | The increment step of the sequence. `int_value` cannot be 0.  If the value is positive, the sequence ascends. If the value is negative, the sequence descends. If this parameter is not specified, the default value is 1. SET GLOBALSET GLOBAL |
| CACHE int_value | The number of sequence values pre-allocated in the memory. By default, `int_value` is 20.  The value of `CACHE int_value` must be greater than 1. If the value of `CACHE int_value` is 1, it is equivalent to `NOCACHE`. SET GLOBAL |
| NOCACHE | Specifies that no sequence values are pre-allocated.  If neither `CACHE` nor `NOCACHE` is specified, the database caches 20 sequence values by default. SET GLOBALSET GLOBAL |
| ORDER | Specifies that sequence values are generated in order. SET GLOBALSET GLOBAL |
| NOORDER | `NOORDER` is the default value, which means it is not assured that sequence values are generated in order. SET GLOBALSET GLOBAL |
| CYCLE | Specifies that sequence values are generated cyclically. That is, when the sequence reaches its maximum or minimum value, new sequence values will also be generated. If the sequence ascends and reaches its maximum value, the minimum sequence value will be generated. If the sequence descends and reaches its minimum value, the maximum sequence value will be generated.  <blockquote><b>Notice</b></br> <ul><li> If `CYCLE` is specified and the value of `INCREMENT BY int_value` is smaller than 0, `MINVALUE` must be specified. </li><li>If `CYCLE` is specified, the number of values in the cache`` cannot be greater than the number of values in the cycle. </li></ul> </blockquote> |
| NOCYCLE | `NOCYCLE` is the default value. If it is specified, no more values are generated when the sequence reaches its maximum or minimum value. SET GLOBALSET GLOBAL |

## Examples

Create a sequence named `seq1` and specify the increment step to 2. In the following example, 1 is returned for the first reference to `seq1.nextval`, and 2 is returned for the second reference. The value returned for each subsequent reference increments by 1.

1. Create a sequence named `seq1`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE SEQUENCE seq1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 5 NOCYCLE NOORDER NOCACHE;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > You can view the sequence that you have created in the `USER_SEQUENCES`, `ALL_SEQUENCES`, and `DBA_SEQUENCES` views.

2. Initiate the first reference to `seq1.nextval`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT seq1.nextval FROM DUAL;
   +---------+
   | NEXTVAL |
   +---------+
   |       1 |
   +---------+
   1 row in set
   ```

3. Initiate the second reference.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT seq1.nextval FROM DUAL;
   +---------+
   | nextval |
   +---------+
   |       2 |
   +---------+
   1 row in set
   ```
