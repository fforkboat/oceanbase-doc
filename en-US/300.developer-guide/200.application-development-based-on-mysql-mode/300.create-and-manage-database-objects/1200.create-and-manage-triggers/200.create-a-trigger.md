# Create a trigger

You can create a DML trigger on a table or a view. A DML trigger event consists of the DELETE, INSERT, and UPDATE DML statements.

## Syntax

You can use a `CREATE TRIGGER` statement to create a trigger.

To create a trigger, you must have the following privileges:

* Privileges on the table associated with the trigger, such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges

* `CREATE TRIGGER` privilege

* Privileges on statements to be executed after the trigger fires

Syntax:

```sql
CREATE
    TRIGGER trigger_name
    trigger_time trigger_event
    ON tbl_name FOR EACH ROW
    trigger_body

trigger_time: { BEFORE | AFTER }

trigger_event: { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE }
```

> **Note**
>
> * `trigger_name`: the name of the trigger. The name must be unique.
> * `tbl_name`: the name of the table for which the trigger is created.
> * `BEFORE` or `AFTER`: specifies whether the trigger fires before or after the triggering event. For example, whether the trigger fires before or after each row is inserted into the associated table.
> * `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`: the type of operation for which the trigger fires.
> * `FOR EACH ROW`: the trigger entity. This statement is executed when the trigger fires and is executed for each row affected by the trigger event.
>
> OceanBase Database also supports `NEW.columnName` and `OLD.columnName`.
>
> * For an `INSERT` trigger, `NEW.columnName` specifies new data that is inserted in a `BEFORE` scenario or was inserted in an `AFTER` scenario.
>    `columnName` refers to a column name in the corresponding table.
> * For an `UPDATE` trigger, `OLD.columnName` specifies existing data that is updated. `NEW.columnName` specifies new data after the update.
> * For a `DELETE` trigger, `OLD.columnName` specifies existing data that is deleted.
> * Values in `OLD.columnName` are read-only, whereas values in `NEW.columnName` can be specified by using `SET` statements.

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Note** |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| BEFORE or AFTER | Specifies whether the trigger fires before or after the trigger event.  | A BEFORE trigger fires before the trigger event is executed. An AFTER trigger fires after the trigger event is executed.  |
| FOR EACH ROW | Specifies the trigger to a row-level trigger.  | If a DML statement affects multiple rows of data in a table, the row-level trigger fires for each row.  |
| REFERENCING | The correlation name. The correlation name can be used to reference the current new and old column values in the Procedural Language (PL) block of the row-level trigger. The default correlation names are `OLD` and `NEW`.  | Examples: `new.c1` and `old.c2`  |

## Examples

Create a simple trigger.

1. Create a table named `regions`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE TABLE regions(
                region_id    NUMBER(5,0),
               region_name  VARCHAR(50)
              );
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. Insert data into the `regions` table.

   ```unknow
   obclient> INSERT INTO regions VALUES(1,'Europe'),(4,'Middle East and Africa'),(3,'Asia'),(2,'Americas');
   d Query OK, 4 rows affected
   Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
   ```

3. Create a table named `reg_his`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE TABLE reg_his AS SELECT * FROM regions WHERE 1=2;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

4. Create a trigger named `del_new_region`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE TRIGGER del_new_region
               BEFORE DELETE ON regions
               FOR EACH ROW
               BEGIN
               INSERT INTO reg_his(region_id , region_name )
               VALUES( old.region_id, old.region_name );
             END;/
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > Before creating the trigger, use the Delimiter function to specify slashes (`/`) as the delimiter, so that semicolons (;) will not be taken as the delimiter and statements before semicolons (;) will not be executed until the actual delimiter is detected.

5. View the `del_new_region` trigger.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE TRIGGER_NAME= 'del_new_region'\G;
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
              TRIGGER_CATALOG: def
               TRIGGER_SCHEMA: ny
                 TRIGGER_NAME: del_new_region
           EVENT_MANIPULATION: DELETE
         EVENT_OBJECT_CATALOG: def
          EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA: ny
           EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE: regions
                 ACTION_ORDER: 0
             ACTION_CONDITION: NULL
             ACTION_STATEMENT: TRIGGER del_new_region
            BEFORE DELETE ON regions
          FOR EACH ROW
      BEGIN
         INSERT INTO reg_his(region_id , region_name )
              VALUES( old.region_id, old.region_name );
      END
           ACTION_ORIENTATION: ROW
                ACTION_TIMING: BEFORE
   ACTION_REFERENCE_OLD_TABLE: NULL
   ACTION_REFERENCE_NEW_TABLE: NULL
     ACTION_REFERENCE_OLD_ROW: OLD
     ACTION_REFERENCE_NEW_ROW: NEW
                      CREATED: NULL
                     SQL_MODE: STRICT_ALL_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE
                      DEFINER: 'root'@'%'
         CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT: utf8mb4
         COLLATION_CONNECTION: utf8mb4
           DATABASE_COLLATION: utf8mb4
   1 row in set
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > Parameters in the preceding statement:
   >
   > * TRIGGER_SCHEMA: the database where the trigger resides.
   > * TRIGGER_NAME: the name of the trigger.
   > * EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE: the data table where the trigger fires.
   > * ACTION_STATEMENT: the action performed when the trigger fires.
   > * ACTION_ORIENTATION: The value ROW indicates that the trigger fires on each record.
   > * ACTION_TIMING: the time when the trigger fires.

## Limits

Triggers in MySQL mode have the following limits:

* Multiple triggers that are associated with the same table cannot share the triggering event or firing time.

* You can create a trigger only for a permanent table, but not for a temporary table.

* Triggers cannot use the `CALL` statement to return data to clients or use the stored procedures of dynamic SQL statements. However, stored procedures and functions can use `OUT` or `INOUT` to return data to triggers.

* Triggers cannot use clauses to start or end transactions, such as `START TRANSACTION` for starting a transaction, `COMMIT` for committing a transaction, and `ROLLBACK` for rolling back a transaction. However, triggers can roll back a transaction to a specific savepoint because this operation does not end the transaction.

* A foreign key cannot activate a trigger.

* A trigger cannot return a value. Make sure that the trigger does not contain a statement that is used to return values. If you want to instantly stop a trigger, use a `LEAVE` statement.
