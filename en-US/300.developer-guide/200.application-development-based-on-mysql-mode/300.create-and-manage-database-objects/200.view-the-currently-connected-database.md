> In the preceding figure, `information_schema` is the currently connected database.

## View the currently connected database by using an SQL statement

### SQL statement

```sql
show databases;
```

### Examples

1. View all databases.

   ```sql
   obclient> show databases;
   +--------------------+
   | Database           |
   +--------------------+
   | oceanbase          |
   | information_schema |
   | mysql              |
   | test               |
   | test2              |
   | rainoon            |
   +--------------------+
   6 rows in set
   ```

2. Enter the `test` database.

   ```sql
   obclient> use ny;
   Database changed
   ```

3. View the currently connected database.

   ```sql
   obclient> show processlist;
   +------------+------+----------------------+------+---------+------+--------+------------------+
   | Id         | User | Host                 | db   | Command | Time | State  | Info             |
   +------------+------+----------------------+------+---------+------+--------+------------------+
   | 3221601356 | root | 47.100.XX.XX:22716 | ny   | Query   |    0 | ACTIVE | show processlist |
   +------------+------+----------------------+------+---------+------+--------+------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > In the preceding sample code, `ny` in the `db` column indicates the currently connected database.
