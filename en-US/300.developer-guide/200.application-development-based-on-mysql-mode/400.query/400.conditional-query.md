# Conditional queries

To query data that satisfies specified conditions, add a WHERE clause to the SELECT statement.

## Syntax

When a conditional query is executed, the records that meet the conditions specified by the `WHERE` clause are returned, and then the columns specified by the `SELECT` keyword are selected.

SQL statement syntax for conditional queries:

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM table_list
WHERE query_condition
```

The `WHERE` keyword can be followed by one or more conditions. The conditions filter the data specified by the `WHERE` clause, and only data that meets the conditions is returned.

## General query conditions

The following table lists general query conditions specified by the `WHERE` clause.

| Condition type | Predicate |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Comparison condition | =, \>, \<, \>=, \<=, !=, \<\> |
| Logical condition (multiple conditions supported in a query) | AND, OR, NOT |
| Fuzzy condition (matching by characters) | LIKE, NOT LIKE |
| Interval condition (with a specified range) | BETWEEN AND, NOT BETWEEN AND |
| Condition with a specified set | IN, NOT IN |
| Condition related to NULL values | IS NULL, IS NOT NULL |

## Queries with comparison operators

Comparison operators include equal to (`=`), greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), less than or equal to (`<=`), and not equal to (`!=` and `<>`).

### Equal to (=)

Returns data equal to the value in the specified column. If the value is a string, enclose the value with single quotation marks (' ') or double quotation marks (" "). Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name [,column_name...] FROM table_name WHERE column_name = const_value;
```

Examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE deptno = 30;
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| ALLEN   |     30 |
| BLAKE   |     30 |
+---------+--------+
2 rows in set

obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE deptno = '30';
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| ALLEN   |     30 |
| BLAKE   |     30 |
+---------+--------+
2 rows in set

obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE empname = 'ALLEN';
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| ALLEN   |     30 |
+---------+--------+
1 row in set
```

### Not equal to (\<\> and !=)

Not equal to operators include `<>` and `!=`. Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name [,column_name...] FROM table_name WHERE column_name <> const_value;
SELECT column_name [,column_name...] FROM table_name WHERE column_name != const_value;
```

Examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE deptno <> 30;
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| SMITH   |     20 |
| JONES   |     40 |
| SCOTT   |     20 |
| FORD    |     40 |
+---------+--------+
4 rows in set

obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE deptno != 30;
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| SMITH   |     20 |
| JONES   |     40 |
| SCOTT   |     20 |
| FORD    |     40 |
+---------+--------+
4 rows in set
```

### Greater than (\>) and less than (\<)

The greater than operator (`>`) and the less than operator (`<`) compare numbers. If characters are compared, they are converted into their respective ASCII codes, and then the ASCII codes are compared from left to right. Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name [,column_name...] FROM table_name WHERE column_name < const_value;
SELECT column_name [,column_name...] FROM table_name WHERE column_name > const_value;
```

> **Note**
>
> The equal to or greater than (>=) and equal to or less than (<=) operators operate in a similar manner.

Examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE deptno > 30;
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| JONES   |     40 |
| FORD    |     40 |
+---------+--------+
2 rows in set

obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE deptno >= 30;
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| ALLEN   |     30 |
| JONES   |     40 |
| BLAKE   |     30 |
| FORD    |     40 |
+---------+--------+
4 rows in set

obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE deptno < 30;
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| SMITH   |     20 |
| SCOTT   |     20 |
+---------+--------+
2 rows in set

obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE deptno <= 30;
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| SMITH   |     20 |
| ALLEN   |     30 |
| BLAKE   |     30 |
| SCOTT   |     20 |
+---------+--------+
4 rows in set
```

## Queries with logical conditions

Logical operators include `AND` and `OR` and support queries with multiple conditions.

### AND

Data that meets both conditions combined by `AND` is returned. Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name [,column_name...] FROM table_name WHERE
query_condition AND query_condition;
```

Example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE deptno <=30 AND sal>1000;
+---------+--------+---------+
| empname | deptno | sal     |
+---------+--------+---------+
| ALLEN   |     30 | 1600.00 |
| BLAKE   |     30 | 2850.00 |
| SCOTT   |     20 | 3000.00 |
+---------+--------+---------+
3 rows in set
```

### OR

Data that meets either of the conditions combined by OR is returned. Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name [,column_name...] FROM table_name WHERE
query_condition OR query_condition;
```

Example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE deptno<=30 OR sal>1000;
+---------+--------+---------+
| empname | deptno | sal     |
+---------+--------+---------+
| SMITH   |     20 |  800.00 |
| ALLEN   |     30 | 1600.00 |
| JONES   |     40 | 2975.00 |
| BLAKE   |     30 | 2850.00 |
| SCOTT   |     20 | 3000.00 |
| FORD    |     40 | 3000.00 |
+---------+--------+---------+
6 rows in set
```

## LIKE

The predicate `LIKE` matches strings. Syntax:

```sql
[NOT] LIKE pattern
```

The LIKE predicate searches the specified column value and returns the data that match the specified `pattern`. The `pattern` can be a complete string or contain wildcards `%` and `_`. Notes:

* The underscore (_) exactly matches any character in the value.

* The percent sign (%) matches zero or multiple characters in the value. The pattern "%" cannot match `NULL`.

In the following example, the first four letters of the employee name are "ALLE" and the last letter is any character.
```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE empname LIKE 'ALLE_';
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| ALLEN   |     30 |
+---------+--------+
1 row in set
```

In the following example, the first letter of the employee name is "A".

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, deptno FROM emp WHERE empname LIKE 'A%';
+---------+--------+
| empname | deptno |
+---------+--------+
| ALLEN   |     30 |
+---------+--------+
1 row in set
```

> **Notice**
>
> If the database character set uses ASCII, one Chinese character needs two underscores (`_`); if the database character set uses GBK, one Chinese character needs only one underscore (`_`).

## BETWEEN AND

The `BETWEEN AND` operator selects values between two values. These values can be numerals, literals, or dates. Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name [,column_name...] FROM table_name WHERE
[NOT] BETWEEN min_const_value AND max_const_value;
```

> **Notice**
>
> The bound values of an interval query cannot be exchanged because the values between them must be greater than or equal to the left value and less than or equal to the right value.

Example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM emp WHERE sal BETWEEN 2000 AND 2999;
+-------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------+------+--------+
| empno | empname | job     | mgr  | hiredate   | sal     | comm | deptno |
+-------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------+------+--------+
|  1566 | JONES   | MANAGER | 1839 | 1981-04-02 | 2975.00 | NULL |     40 |
|  1698 | BLAKE   | MANAGER | 1839 | 1981-05-01 | 2850.00 | NULL |     30 |
+-------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------+------+--------+
2 rows in set
```

## IN

The `IN` operator specifies multiple values in a `WHERE` clause. The values can be treated as a set. The `IN` operator returns data, in the specified column, that matches any value in the set. The `NOT IN` operator returns data, in the specified column, that does not match any value in the set. Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name [,column_name...] FROM table_name WHERE
column_name [NOT] IN (const_value,const_value,const_value...);
```

> **Notice**
>
> * The value types in the `[NOT] IN` set must be consistent or compatible with each other.
> * The values in the `[NOT] IN` set do not support wildcards.

Example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM emp WHERE deptno IN (30,40,50,60);
+-------+---------+----------+------+------------+---------+--------+--------+
| empno | empname | job      | mgr  | hiredate   | sal     | comm   | deptno |
+-------+---------+----------+------+------------+---------+--------+--------+
|  1499 | ALLEN   | SALESMAN | 1698 | 1981-02-20 | 1600.00 | 300.00 |     30 |
|  1566 | JONES   | MANAGER  | 1839 | 1981-04-02 | 2975.00 |   NULL |     40 |
|  1698 | BLAKE   | MANAGER  | 1839 | 1981-05-01 | 2850.00 |   NULL |     30 |
|  1902 | FORD    | ANALYST  | 1566 | 1981-12-05 | 3000.00 |   NULL |     40 |
+-------+---------+----------+------+------------+---------+--------+--------+
4 rows in set
```

## NULL value queries

The comparison operators and the `LIKE`, `BETWEEN AND`, `IN`, and `NOT IN` operators cannot accurately retrieve `NULL` values. Therefore, we recommend that you use the following special query conditions for NULL values: `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`.

### IS NULL

`IS NULL` queries `NULL` values from the specified column. Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name [,column_name...] FROM table_name WHERE
column_name IS NULL;
```

Example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM emp WHERE comm IS NULL;
+-------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------+------+--------+
| empno | empname | job     | mgr  | hiredate   | sal     | comm | deptno |
+-------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------+------+--------+
|  1369 | SMITH   | CLERK   | 1902 | 1980-12-17 |  800.00 | NULL |     20 |
|  1566 | JONES   | MANAGER | 1839 | 1981-04-02 | 2975.00 | NULL |     40 |
|  1698 | BLAKE   | MANAGER | 1839 | 1981-05-01 | 2850.00 | NULL |     30 |
|  1788 | SCOTT   | ANALYST | 1566 | 1987-07-15 | 3000.00 | NULL |     20 |
|  1902 | FORD    | ANALYST | 1566 | 1981-12-05 | 3000.00 | NULL |     40 |
+-------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------+------+--------+
5 rows in set
```

### IS NOT NULL

`IS NOT NULL` queries non-`NULL` values from the specified column. Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column_name [,column_name...] FROM table_name WHERE
column_name IS NOT NULL;
```

Examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM emp WHERE comm IS NOT NULL;
+-------+---------+----------+------+------------+---------+--------+--------+
| empno | empname | job      | mgr  | hiredate   | sal     | comm   | deptno |
+-------+---------+----------+------+------------+---------+--------+--------+
|  1499 | ALLEN   | SALESMAN | 1698 | 1981-02-20 | 1600.00 | 300.00 |     30 |
+-------+---------+----------+------+------------+---------+--------+--------+
1 row in set
```

You can also use the safe equal to operator (`<=>`) to judge the `NULL` values as well as normal numerals. Examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname, comm FROM emp WHERE comm <=> NULL;
+---------+------+
| empname | comm |
+---------+------+
| SMITH   | NULL |
| JONES   | NULL |
| BLAKE   | NULL |
| SCOTT   | NULL |
| FORD    | NULL |
+---------+------+
5 rows in set
```
