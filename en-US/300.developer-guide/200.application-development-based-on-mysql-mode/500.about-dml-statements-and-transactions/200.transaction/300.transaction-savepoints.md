# Transaction savepoints

This topic describes how to use transaction savepoints.

## Syntax

The `SAVEPOINT` statement marks a savepoint during a transaction. You can roll back a transaction to a savepoint. Savepoints are optional. A transaction can have multiple savepoints.

* Syntax for marking a savepoint:

   ```sql
   SAVEPOINT pointname;
   ```

   | Parameter | Required | Description | Examples |
   |-----------|------|-------------|----|
   | pointname | Yes | The name of the savepoint.  | fr |

* Syntax for releasing a savepoint:

   > **Notice**
   >
   > After the `RELEASE SAVEPOINT``` statement is successfully executed, you cannot roll back the transaction to the released savepoint, or any other savepoints between this statement and this savepoint.

   ```sql
   RELEASE SAVEPOINT pointname;
   ```

* Syntax for rolling back to a specified savepoint:

   ```sql
   ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT pointname;
   ```

   For more information, see [Roll back a transaction](../200.transaction/500.roll-back-transactions.md).

## Example: Roll back a transaction to a savepoint

The transaction in the following example contains several DML statements and several savepoints. After the transaction is rolled back to a specific savepoint, only the changes after this savepoint are discarded.

1. View the records in the table.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   | id | name | value | gmt_create          |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 1970-01-01 16:05:45 |
   |  2 | US   | 10002 | 1970-01-01 16:05:54 |
   |  3 | UK   | 10003 | 1970-01-01 16:05:54 |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

2. Start a transaction and set several savepoints.

   ```sql
   obclient> SET session autocommit=off;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> BEGIN;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> INSERT INTO t_insert(id, name) VALUES(6,'FR');
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient> SAVEPOINT fr;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> INSERT INTO t_insert(id, name) VALUES(7,'RU');
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient> SAVEPOINT ru;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> INSERT INTO t_insert(id, name) VALUES(8,'CA');
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient>SAVEPOINT ca;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. View the uncommitted changes in the transaction of the current session.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   | id | name | value | gmt_create          |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 1970-01-01 16:05:45 |
   |  2 | US   | 10002 | 1970-01-01 16:05:54 |
   |  3 | UK   | 10003 | 1970-01-01 16:05:54 |
   |  6 | FR   |  NULL | 1970-01-01 16:26:22 |
   |  7 | RU   |  NULL | 1970-01-01 16:26:32 |
   |  8 | CA   |  NULL | 1970-01-01 16:26:42 |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   6 rows in set
   ```

4. Roll back the transaction to one of its savepoints.

   ```sql
   obclient> ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT ru;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   | id | name | value | gmt_create          |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 1970-01-01 16:05:45 |
   |  2 | US   | 10002 | 1970-01-01 16:05:54 |
   |  3 | UK   | 10003 | 1970-01-01 16:05:54 |
   |  6 | FR   |  NULL | 1970-01-01 16:26:22 |
   |  7 | RU   |  NULL | 1970-01-01 16:26:32 |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   5 rows in set
   ```

5. Commit the transaction and make sure that the latest changes include those made before the savepoint.

   ```sql
   obclient> COMMIT;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   | id | name | value | gmt_create          |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 1970-01-01 16:05:45 |
   |  2 | US   | 10002 | 1970-01-01 16:05:54 |
   |  3 | UK   | 10003 | 1970-01-01 16:05:54 |
   |  6 | FR   |  NULL | 1970-01-01 16:26:22 |
   |  7 | RU   |  NULL | 1970-01-01 16:26:32 |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   5 rows in set
   ```
