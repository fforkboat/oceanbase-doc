# Roll back a transaction

This topic describes how to roll back a transaction.

## Syntax

Rolling back a transaction is to revoke all the changes made in the transaction. Before a transaction is committed, you can roll back the entire transaction or roll back the transaction to any savepoint.

* If you roll back an entire transaction:

   * All changes made in the transaction are discarded.

   * All savepoints are cleared.

   * All locks held by the transaction are released.

   Syntax:

   ```sql
   ROLLBACK;
   ```

* To roll back a transaction to a specific savepoint, use the `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` statement.

   * The transaction does not end.

   * Changes made before the savepoint are retained but those made after it are discarded.

   * All savepoints after the specific savepoint are cleared.

   * All locks held by the transaction after the specific savepoint are released.

   Syntax:

   ```sql
   ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT pointname;
   ```

## Examples

In the following example, `ROLLBACK` is used to revoke all changes made by the current transaction. To roll back the transaction to a savepoint, see [Example: Roll back a transaction to a savepoint](../200.transaction/300.transaction-savepoints.md).
