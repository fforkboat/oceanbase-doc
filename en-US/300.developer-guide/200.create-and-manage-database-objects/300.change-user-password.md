## Change the password of a user by using SQL statements

### Change the password of a user by using the ALTER USER statement

You can execute the `ALTER USER` statement to change the passwords of other users. To execute this statement, you must have the `UPDATE USER` privilege``.

SQL syntax:

```sql
obclient> ALTER USER username IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

Example for changing the password of sqluser01 to `******`:

```sql
obclient> ALTER USER sqluser01 IDENTIFIED BY ******;
```

### Change the password of a user by using the SET PASSWORD statement

You can execute the `SET PASSWORD` statement to change your password or the passwords of other users.

SQL syntax:

```sql
obclient> SET PASSWORD [FOR user] = PASSWORD('password');
```

Notes:

* If the `FOR user` clause is absent, this statement changes the password of the current user. Any logged-on user can change their password.

* If the `FOR user` clause is specified, this statement changes the password of the specified user. To change the password of a specified user, you must have the global `CREATE USER` privilege.

Example for changing the password of `sqluser01` to `******`:

```sql
obclient> SET PASSWORD FOR sqluser01 = password('******');
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
