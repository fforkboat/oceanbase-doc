# About tables

Tables are the most basic data storage units in OceanBase Database.

## Background

A table contains specific data that a user can access. A table consists of rows, and a row consists of columns.

## Table planning rules

Before you create and use tables, you can plan the tables by following these principles:

* Use tables based on the standard procedure and use reasonable table structures to minimize data redundancy.

* Select a suitable SQL data type for each column.

* Choose a suitable table type based on your needs. OceanBase Database supports partitioned and non-partitioned tables.
