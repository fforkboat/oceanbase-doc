# OceanBase Connector/C

OceanBase Call Interface (OBCI) is a C language tool for interface calls in OceanBase Database. It provides features that are fully compatible with Oracle Call Interface (OCI).

OceanBase Call Interface (OBCI) allows you to use the C language to manipulate data in OceanBase Database. OBCI provides standard database access features in the form of a dynamic-link library (OBCI library). Applications can use the features by connecting to this library.

OBCI is a C language call interface provided by OceanBase. It provides features that are compatible with OCI. If you want to use a C application written by using Oracle OCI, you need only to specify the OBCI library as the runtime library during linking. By default, library files are installed in the `/u01/obclient/lib` path.

OBCI publishes software in a RedHat Package Manager (RPM) package. This software package contains a header file, a runtime library, and an instance program.

> **Note**
>
> * If you are building a dynamic link to `libobci.so`, you need to manually install the OBClient RPM package.
> * If you are building a static link to `libobci.a`, the OBClient RPM package is not required.
