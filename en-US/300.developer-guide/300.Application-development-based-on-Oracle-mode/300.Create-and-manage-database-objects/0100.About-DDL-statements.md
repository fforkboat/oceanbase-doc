# About DDL statements

You can use DDL statements to create, update, and delete database objects. This topic describes the background of and database objects supported by DDL statements.

## Background

Before and after a DDL statement is executed, OceanBase Database will send an implicit COMMIT statement. Therefore, a DDL statement cannot be rolled back after being executed. We recommend that you back up data before you perform DDL operations.

> * In the CLI environment of OceanBase Client (OBClient), you can enter a DDL statement after the SQL prompt (`>`).
> * You can also enter a DDL statement in the ODC SQL Editor window.
