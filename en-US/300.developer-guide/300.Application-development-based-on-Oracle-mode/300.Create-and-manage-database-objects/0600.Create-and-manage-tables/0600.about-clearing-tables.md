# About table clearing

You can use the DELETE (without conditions) or TRUNCATE statement to clear a table in OceanBase Database in Oracle mode.

## Prerequisites

The current user has the DELETE privilege for the target table.

## DELETE (without conditions)

### Description

When you use the DELETE statement on a table, you can choose whether to specify conditions.

* A DELETE statement with conditions such as WHERE deletes the data meeting the specified condition from the table.

* A DELETE statement without conditions clears the table.

### Syntax

```unknow
DELETE [hint_options] [FROM] table_factor
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| hint_options | Optional. The hint option.  |
| table_factor | The name of the object from which rows need to be deleted. The object can be a base table, an updatable view, or a special subquery.  |

### Examples

Clear the data in the `dws_ny` table.

1. Query the data in the `dws_ny` table.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT * FROM dws_ny;
   +------+-----------+
   | COL1 | COL2      |
   +------+-----------+
   |    1 | 11-NOV-70 |
   |    2 | 11-NOV-71 |
   |    3 | 11-NOV-71 |
   +------+-----------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

2. Clear the data in the `dws_ny` table.

   ```unknow
   obclient> DELETE FROM dws_ny;
   Query OK, 3 rows affected
   ```

3. Query the data in the `dws_ny` table again.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT * FROM dws_ny;
   Empty set
   ```

## TRUNCATE statement

### Description

You can use this statement to truncate a specified table but retain the table structure, including the partitions of the table. Logically, this statement is equivalent to the `DELETE FROM` statement that is used to delete all rows.

To execute the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement, you must have the DROP and CREATE privileges on the table.

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement differs from the `DELETE FROM` statement in the following aspects:

* The `TRUNCATE TABLE` operation drops a table and creates it again. It is much faster than deleting data row by row, especially for large tables.

* The output of `TRUNCATE TABLE` always indicates that 0 rows were affected.

* When you use `TRUNCATE TABLE`, the table management program does not record the last `AUTO_INCREMENT` value, but resets it to zero.

* The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement cannot be executed during transactions or when the table is locked. Otherwise, an error is returned.

* If the table definition file is valid, you can use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to recreate the table as an empty table, even if the data or indexes are corrupted.

### Syntax

```unknow
TRUNCATE [TABLE] [schema.]table_name;
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| schema. | The schema. If `schema.` is omitted, the table is in the current schema by default.  |
| table_name | The table name.  |

### Examples

Clear the data in the `dws_ny` table.

1. Query the data in the `dws_ny` table.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT * FROM dws_ny;
   +------+-----------+
   | ID   | DATA      |
   +------+-----------+
   |    1 | 11-NOV-70 |
   |    2 | 11-NOV-71 |
   |    3 | 11-NOV-71 |
   +------+-----------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

2. Clear the data in the `dws_ny` table.

   ```unknow
   obclient> TRUNCATE dws_ny;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. Query the data in the `dws_ny` table again.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT * FROM dws_ny;
   Empty set
   ```
