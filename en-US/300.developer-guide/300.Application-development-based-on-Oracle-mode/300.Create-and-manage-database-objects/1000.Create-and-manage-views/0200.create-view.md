# Create a view

You can use the `CREATE VIEW` statement to create a view. This topic describes how to create a normal view.

## Syntax

You can use the CREATE VIEW statement to create a view.

```unknow
create_view_stmt:
  CREATE [OR REPLACE] [[NO] FORCE] VIEW view_name [(column_name_list)] AS select_stmt;

column_name_list:
    column_name [, column_name ...]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|----|----|
| OR REPLACE | Specifies to re-create a view that already exists by using a new definition.  |
| [NO] FORCE | If you want to create a view regardless of whether the base tables of the view or the referenced object types exist, or the owner of the schema containing the view has privileges on them, specify `FORCE`.  If you want to create a view only when the view has base tables and the owner of the schema containing the view has privileges on them, specify `NOFORCE`.  The default value is `NOFORCE`.  |
| view_name | The name of the view.  |
| select_stmt | A `SELECT` statement that defines a view. You can use this statement to query base tables or other views.  |
| column_name_list | The column names in the view, which must be unique, like those in a base table. By default, the column names retrieved by the `SELECT` statement are used as the column names in the view.  You can also use the optional `column_name_list` clause to define column names for a view. Separate multiple column names with commas (,). The number of column names in `column_name_list` must be equal to the number of columns retrieved by the `SELECT` statement.  The `SELECT` statement can directly reference the columns of a table. You can also use functions, constants, and operators in the statement to retrieve columns.  |

## Examples

Create an associated query view named `v` based on the `t1` and `t2` tables.

1. Create a table named `t1`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t1 (id1 int,name varchar(256),sex varchar(256));
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. Create a LIST COLUMNS-partitioned table named `t2`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t2 (id2 int,age int,c_date date);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. Create a view named `v` to retrieve information from the `NAME`, `C_DATE`, `AGE`, and `SEX` fields in `t1` that match the `ID` field in `t2`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE VIEW v
                     AS
                     SELECT
                     id1 as id,name, c_date, age, sex
                     FROM t1 a, t2 b
                     WHERE a.id1 = b.id2;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

4. Show the description of the `v` view.

   ```unknow
   obclient> DESC v;
   +--------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   | FIELD  | TYPE          | NULL | KEY | DEFAULT | EXTRA |
   +--------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   | ID     | NUMBER(38)    | YES  | NULL | NULL    | NULL  |
   | NAME   | VARCHAR2(256) | YES  | NULL | NULL    | NULL  |
   | C_DATE | DATE          | YES  | NULL | NULL    | NULL  |
   | AGE    | NUMBER(38)    | YES  | NULL | NULL    | NULL  |
   | SEX    | VARCHAR2(256) | YES  | NULL | NULL    | NULL  |
   +--------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   5 rows in set
   ```
