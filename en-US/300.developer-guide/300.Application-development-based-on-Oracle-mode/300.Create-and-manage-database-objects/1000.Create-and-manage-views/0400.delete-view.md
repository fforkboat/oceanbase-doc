# Drop a view

You can use the DROP VIEW statement to drop a view. This topic describes how to drop a view.

## Prerequisites

The view must be in your schema, or you must have the `DROP ANY VIEW` privilege if you want to drop the view in another user's schema.

## Syntax

```unknow
DROP VIEW [schema.] view_name [CASCADE | RESTRICT];
```

### Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| schema. | The schema where the view to be dropped is located. If `schema.` is omitted, the view in your schema is dropped.  |
| view_name | The name of the view to be dropped.  |
| CASCADE | RESTRICT | `CASCADE` indicates that the objects dependent on the view are automatically removed.  `RESTRICT` indicates that the view cannot be dropped if an object that depends on the view exists.  <br></br>**Note**</br>The current version does not support this parameter. If this parameter is specified, it will be parsed and ignored.  |

## Examples

Drop the `v1` view.

```unknow
obclient> DROP VIEW v1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
