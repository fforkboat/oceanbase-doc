# About sequences

A sequence is a database object of Oracle tenants. You can use it to generate unique sequential values for the primary key column. This topic describes the basic features of sequences and the differences between sequences in OceanBase Database and Oracle Database.

## Basic features

A sequence has two pseudocolumns: `CURRVAL` and `NEXTVAL`, which respectively return the current value and next value of a sequence. Each query increments the value of `NEXTVAL` and `CURRVAL`.

You can specify the name, interval, and order of the sequence in the definition.
