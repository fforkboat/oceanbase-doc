# Create a sequence

You can use the `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement to create a sequence. This topic describes how to create a sequence.

## Prerequisites

You have the CREATE and ALTER privileges on sequences.

## Description

You can use this statement to create a sequence. A sequence is a database object. You can generate a unique integer from a sequence.

If two users increment the same sequence concurrently, the sequence numbers obtained by the two users have an interval. One user can never obtain the sequence number generated by the other user. Sequence numbers are generated independent of the table. Therefore, you can use the same sequence for multiple tables.

After creating a sequence, you can use the `CURRVAL` pseudocolumn to return the current sequence value or use the `NEXTVAL` pseudocolumn to return the new increment value in the SQL statement.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE [schema. ] sequence_name
[MINVALUE int_value | NOMINVALUE]
[MAXVALUE int_value | NOMAXVALUE]
[START WITH int_value]
[INCREMENT BY int_value]
[CACHE int_value | NOCACHE]
[ORDER | NOORDER]
[CYCLE | NOCYCLE];
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MINVALUE int_value \| NOMINVALUE | The minimum value of the sequence. Value range: [(-10<sup>27</sup>+1),(10<sup>28</sup>-1)].  If `NOMINVALUE` is specified, the minimum value is 1 for an ascending sequence, and -(10<sup>27</sup>-1) for a descending sequence.  If no minimum value is specified, `NOMINVALUE` takes effect by default.  |
| MAXVALUE int_value | NOMAXVALUE | The maximum value of the sequence. Value range: [(-10<sup>27</sup>+1,10<sup>28</sup>-1)].  If `NOMAXVALUE` is specified, the maximum value is (10<sup>28</sup>-1 for an ascending sequence, and -1 for a descending sequence.  If no maximum value is specified, `NOMAXVALUE` takes effect by default.  |
| START WITH int_value | The start value of the sequence. The value must be smaller than or equal to `MAXVALUE`, and greater than or equal to `MINVALUE`.  If no start value is specified, the start value is the minimum value for an ascending sequence and the maximum value for a descending sequence.  |
| INCREMENT BY int_value | The increment step of the sequence. The value cannot be 0.  If the value is positive, the sequence ascends. If the value is negative, the sequence descends.  If this parameter is not specified, the default value is 1.  |
| CACHE int_value | NOCACHE | The number of sequence values that the database preallocates and keeps in memory. The default value is 20.  |
| ORDER | NOORDER | Specifies whether sequence values are generated in order. The default value is `NOORDER`.  |
| CYCLE | NOCYCLE | Specifies whether sequence values are generated cyclically. The default value is `NOCYCLE`.  |

## Examples

Create a sequence named `seq1` and specify the increment to 1. In the following example, 1 is returned for the first reference to `seq1.nextval`, and 2 is returned for the second reference. The value returned for each subsequent reference increments by 1.

1. Create a sequence named `seq1`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE SEQUENCE seq1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 5 NOCYCLE NOORDER NOCACHE;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > You can view the sequence that you have created in the `USER_SEQUENCES`, `ALL_SEQUENCES`, and `DBA_SEQUENCES` views.

2. Initiate the first reference to `seq1.nextval`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT seq1.nextval FROM DUAL;
   +---------+
   | NEXTVAL |
   +---------+
   |       1 |
   +---------+
   1 row in set
   ```

3. Initiate the second reference.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT seq1.nextval FROM DUAL;
   +---------+
   | NEXTVAL |
   +---------+
   |       2 |
   +---------+
   1 row in set
   ```
