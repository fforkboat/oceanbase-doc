# Delete a sequence

You can use the DROP SEQUENCE statement to drop a sequence. This topic describes how to drop a sequence.

## Syntax

```unknow
DROP SEQUENCE [schema.] sequence_name;
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| schema. | The schema where the sequence to be dropped is located.  If `schema.` is not specified, the sequence to be dropped is located in the schema of the currently logged-on user.  |
| sequence_name | The name of the sequence to be dropped.  |

## Examples

1. View the `seq1` sequence.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT sequence_name,max_value FROM USER_SEQUENCES
             WHERE SEQUENCE_NAME = 'SEQ1';
   +---------------+-----------+
   | SEQUENCE_NAME | MAX_VALUE |
   +---------------+-----------+
   | SEQ1          |         5 |
   +---------------+-----------+
   1 row in set
   ```

2. Drop the sequence named `seq1`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> DROP SEQUENCE seq1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. View the `seq1` sequence again.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT sequence_name,max_value FROM USER_SEQUENCES
             WHERE SEQUENCE_NAME = 'SEQ1';
   Empty set
   ```
