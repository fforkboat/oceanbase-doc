# About synonyms

A synonym is an alias for a schema object of an Oracle tenant. You can create a synonym for a table, view, sequence, stored procedure, function, package, object type, custom object type, or other objects. As an alias, a synonym requires no storage other than its definition in the data dictionary. This topic describes the types, basic features, and required privileges of synonyms.

## Category

You can create private and public synonyms.

A public synonym can be used by every database user and is owned by a group named `PUBLIC`. A private synonym is contained in the schema of a specific user and is available only to its owner and users who are granted access to the underlying object.

Public synonyms can be created by database administrators and regular users who are granted the `CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM` privilege.

## Basic features

Synonyms extend the availability of database objects and allow them to be accessed by different database users with the required privileges. This design simplifies and secures access to database objects.
