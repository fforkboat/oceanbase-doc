# Create a synonym

You can use the `CREATE SYNONYM` statement to create a synonym. This topic describes how to create a synonym.

## Prerequisites

* To create a private synonym in your schema, you must have the `CREATE SYNONYM` system privilege.

* To create a private synonym in the schema of another user, you must have the `CREATE ANY SYNONYM` system privilege.

* To create a public synonym, you must have the `CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM` system privilege.

## Syntax

```unknow
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] [ PUBLIC ]
SYNONYM [ schema. ]synonym
FOR [ schema. ]object;
```

### Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OR REPLACE | Re-creates a synonym if it already exists.  |
| PUBLIC | Specifies to create a public synonym, which can be used by all users. Only users with the corresponding privileges on the underlying object can use this synonym.  A public synonym is used in parsing the reference to an object only when no schema is specified for the object.  If `PUBLIC` is omitted, the synonym is private. A private synonym name must be unique in its schema and can be accessed only by using its schema.  |
| \[schema. \]synonym | Specifies the schema to which the synonym to be created belongs. If you have specified `PUBLIC`, you cannot specify the schema for the synonym.  The `synonym` field specifies the name of the synonym.  |
| \[schema. \]object | Specifies the name of the object that the synonym corresponds to.  |

> **Note**
>
> You can check the synonyms that you have created in the USER_SYNONYMS, ALL_SYNONYMS, and DBA_SYNONYMS views.

## Examples

### Example 1

To create a private synonym as another user, you must grant the `CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE SYNONYM` privileges to this user.

1. Log on as the `SYS` user and create a user named `ny`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE USER ny IDENTIFIED BY ***4**;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. Grant the CREATE TABLE privilege to the `ny` user.

   ```unknow
   obclient> GRANT CREATE TABLE TO ny;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. Grant the CREATE SYNONYM privilege to the `ny` user.

   ```unknow
   obclient> GRANT CREATE SYNONYM TO ny;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

4. Create a table named `dws_ny` as the `ny` user.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE TABLE dws_ny(c1 NUMBER);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

5. Create a synonym named `s1` as the `ny` user.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE SYNONYM s1 FOR dws_ny;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

6. View the `s1` synonym.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT * FROM USER_SYNONYMS WHERE SYNONYM_NAME = 'S1';
   +--------------+-------------+------------+---------+---------------+
   | SYNONYM_NAME | TABLE_OWNER | TABLE_NAME | DB_LINK | ORIGIN_CON_ID |
   +--------------+-------------+------------+---------+---------------+
   | S1           | NY          | DWS_NY     | NULL    |             0 |
   +--------------+-------------+------------+---------+---------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

> **Note**
>
> If the `ny` user is not granted the CREATE TABLE and CREATE SYNONYM privileges, the `ORA-00900: invalid SQL statement` error is returned when you create a table or synonym as the ny user.

### Example 2

Create a private synonym.

1. Create a table named `dws_ny`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE TABLE dws_ny(c1 NUMBER);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. Create a synonym named `sp`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE SYNONYM sp FOR dws_ny;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. Insert data into the `dws_ny` table by using the `sp` synonym.

   ```unknow
   obclient> INSERT INTO sp VALUES(1);
   ```

4. View the `dws_ny` table.

   ```unknow
   bclient> SELECT * FROM dws_ny;
   +------+
   | c1   |
   +------+
   |    1 |
   +------+
   1 row in set
   ```

### Example 3

Create a public synonym.

1. Create a table named `dws_ny1`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE TABLE dws_ny1(c1 NUMBER);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. Create a synonym named `spb`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM spb FOR dws_ny1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. View the `spb` synonym.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT * FROM spb;
   +------+
   | c1   |
   +------+
   |    1 |
   +------+
   1 row in set
   ```
