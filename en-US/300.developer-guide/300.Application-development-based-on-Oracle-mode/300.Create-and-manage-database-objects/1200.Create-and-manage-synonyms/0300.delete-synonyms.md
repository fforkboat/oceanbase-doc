# Delete a synonym

You can use the `DROP SYNONYM` statement to drop a synonym. This topic describes how to drop a synonym.

## Prerequisites

* To drop a private synonym, you must be the owner of this private synonym, or have the `DROP ANY SYNONYM` system privilege.

* To drop a public synonym, you must have the `DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM` system privilege.

## Syntax

```unknow
DROP [PUBLIC] SYNONYM [ schema. ]synonym;
```

### Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PUBLIC | You can specify `PUBLIC` to drop a public synonym. If you do not specify `PUBLIC`, a private synonym is dropped.  |
| [ schema. ]synonym | Specifies the schema to which the synonym to be created belongs.  If you have specified `PUBLIC`, you cannot specify the schema for the synonym.  The `synonym` field specifies the name of the synonym.  |
