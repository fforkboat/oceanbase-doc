# Create a trigger

You can create a DML trigger on a table or a view. A DML trigger event consists of the DELETE, INSERT, and UPDATE DML statements.

## Types of DML row-level triggers

The current version of OceanBase Database supports the following types of DML row-level triggers:

* `BEFORE INSERT FOR EACH ROW`

* `AFTER INSERT FOR EACH ROW`

* `BEFORE UPDATE FOR EACH ROW`

* `AFTER UPDATE FOR EACH ROW`

* `BEFORE DELETE FOR EACH ROW`

* `AFTER DELETE FOR EACH ROW`

Unlike stored procedures and packages, a trigger has a separate namespace. Therefore, the name of a trigger can be identical to the name of a table or stored procedure.

## Syntax

You can use a `CREATE TRIGGER` statement to create a trigger.

To create a trigger, you must have the following privileges:

* Privileges on the table associated with the trigger, such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges

* `CREATE TRIGGER` privilege

* Privileges on statements to be executed after the trigger fires

```unknow
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER }
{INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE [OF column [, column â€¦]]}
ON [schema.] table_name
[REFERENCING {OLD [AS] old | NEW [AS] new| PARENT as parent}]
FOR EACH ROW
[WHEN condition]
trigger_body;
```

> **Note**
>
> * `trigger_name`: the name of the trigger. The name must be unique.
> * `tbl_name`: the name of the table for which the trigger is created.
> * `BEFORE` or `AFTER`: specifies whether the trigger fires before or after the triggering event. For example, whether the trigger fires before or after each row is inserted into the associated table.
> * `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`: the type of operation for which the trigger fires.
> * `FOR EACH ROW`: the trigger entity. This statement is executed when the trigger fires and is executed for each row affected by the trigger event.
>
> OceanBase Database also supports `NEW.columnName` and `OLD.columnName`.
>
> * For an `INSERT` trigger, `NEW.columnName` specifies new data that is inserted in a `BEFORE` scenario or was inserted in an `AFTER` scenario.
>
>    `columnName` indicates a column name in the corresponding data table.
> * For an `UPDATE` trigger, `OLD.columnName` specifies existing data that is updated. `NEW.columnName` specifies new data after the update.
> * For a `DELETE` trigger, `OLD.columnName` specifies existing data that is deleted.
> * Values in `OLD.columnName` are read-only, whereas values in `NEW.columnName` can be specified by using `SET` statements.

### Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Note** |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| BEFORE or AFTER | Specifies whether the trigger fires before or after the trigger event.  | A BEFORE trigger fires before the trigger event is executed. An AFTER trigger fires after the trigger event is executed.  |
| FOR EACH ROW | Specifies the trigger to a row-level trigger.  | If a DML statement affects multiple rows of data in a table, the row-level trigger fires for each row.  |
| REFERENCING | The correlation name. The correlation name can be used to reference the current new and old column values in the Procedural Language (PL) block of the row-level trigger. The default correlation names are `OLD` and `NEW`.  | Examples: `new.c1` and `old.c2`  |

## Limits on triggers

Note the following limits when you use triggers:

* The `SELECT` statement in a trigger must use the `SELECT ... INTO ...` syntax, or be the `SELECT` statement used to define a cursor.

* Transaction control statements such as `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT` cannot be used in a trigger.

* A stored procedure or function called by a trigger cannot contain database transaction control statements either.

### OLD and NEW pseudorecords

When a trigger is executed, it needs to reference the column values in records for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations and sometimes needs to reference the column values before or after the operations.

* `:NEW` indicates the value of a column after an operation.

* `:OLD` indicates the value of a column before an operation.

The following table lists the validity of NEW and OLD records in different operations.

| **Feature** | **INSERT** | **UPDATE** | **DELETE** |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| **OLD** | NULL | Valid | Valid |
| **NEW** | Valid | Valid | NULL |

### Examples

When data is dropped from the `regions` table, use triggers to move records with a `region_id` value greater than 3 to the `reg_his` table.

1. Create a table named `regions`.

   ```unknow
   obclient>CREATE TABLE regions(
           region_id     NUMBER(5,0),  
           region_name  VARCHAR(50)
       );
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. Insert data into the `regions` table.

   ```unknow
   obclient> INSERT INTO regions VALUES(1,'Europe'),(4,'Middle East and Africa'),(3,'Asia'),(2,'Americas');
   Query OK, 4 rows affected
   Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
   ```

3. Create a table named `reg_his`, which has the same structure as the `regions` table.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE TABLE reg_his AS SELECT * FROM regions WHERE 1=2;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

4. Create a trigger named `del_new_region`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE TRIGGER del_new_region
         BEFORE DELETE ON regions
         FOR EACH ROW
         WHEN (old.region_id >3)
      BEGIN
         INSERT INTO reg_his(region_id , region_name )
              VALUES( :old.region_id, :old.region_name );
      END;
    /
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

5. View the `regions` table.

   ```unknow
   obclient>SELECT * FROM regions;
   +-----------+------------------------+
   | REGION_ID | REGION_NAME            |
   +-----------+------------------------+
   |         1 | Europe                 |
   |         4 | Middle East and Africa |
   |         3 | Asia                   |
   |         2 | Americas               |
   +-----------+------------------------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

6. View the `reg_his` table.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT * FROM reg_his;
   Empty set
   ```

7. Delete the data records whose region_id is greater than 2 from the `regions` table.

   ```unknow
   obclient> DELETE FROM regions WHERE region_id>2;
   Query OK, 2 rows affected
   ```

8. View the `regions` table again.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT * FROM regions;
   +-----------+-------------+
   | REGION_ID | REGION_NAME |
   +-----------+-------------+
   |         1 | Europe      |
   |         2 | Americas    |
   +-----------+-------------+
   2 rows in set
   ```

9. View the `reg_his` table again.

   ```unknow
   obclient>SELECT * FROM reg_his;
   +-----------+------------------------+
   | REGION_ID | REGION_NAME            |
   +-----------+------------------------+
   |         4 | Middle East and Africa |
   +-----------+------------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

## Create an INSTEAD OF trigger

You can create an INSTEAD OF trigger on an uneditable view to update the view. An INSTEAD OF trigger can determine the expected operations and execute appropriate DML operations on the base table.

An INSTEAD OF trigger can only be a row-level trigger. An INSTEAD OF DML trigger can read but not modify the OLD and NEW values.

Syntax for creating an INSTEAD OF trigger:

```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
INSTEAD OF
{INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE}
ON [schema.] view_name
[FOR EACH ROW]
BEGIN
...
END;
```

Notes:

* `OR REPLACE`: If the name of the trigger to be created already exists, a new trigger is created based on the specified definition.

* `view_name`: the name of the view. An INSTEAD OF trigger can be created only on a view.

* You must have the `CREATE TRIGGER` system privilege to create triggers.

Example: Use an INSTEAD OF trigger to update a view.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE customers(
    customer_id             NUMBER(20) NOT NULL ,
    cust_last_name          VARCHAR(25) DEFAULT NULL,
    cust_first_name         VARCHAR(25) DEFAULT NULL,
    cust_address            VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT NULL,
    cust_nationkey          NUMBER(20) DEFAULT NULL,
    cust_phone              CHAR(15) DEFAULT NULL,
    cust_acctbal            DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT NULL,
    cust_mktsegment         CHAR(10) DEFAULT NULL,
    cust_comment            VARCHAR(117) DEFAULT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(customer_id));
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE orders(
    order_id                 NUMBER(20) NOT NULL ,
    customer_id              NUMBER(20) NOT NULL ,
    order_status             CHAR(1) DEFAULT NULL,

    order_comment            VARCHAR(79) DEFAULT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(order_id,order_date,customer_id));

     SELECT c.customer_id, c.cust_last_name, c.cust_first_name,
          o.order_id, o.order_date, o.order_status
     FROM customers c, orders o
     WHERE c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

## Create a composite trigger

### Overview

A composite trigger created on a table or editable view can fire at multiple points in time. A composite trigger is segmented based on each point in time. Each time segment has its own executable part and exception-handling part (optional). All the parts can access a universal procedural language (PL) state. The universal state is created when the trigger statement starts being executed and destroyed after the trigger statement is executed. It is not affected even if the trigger statement causes errors.

### Limits on composite triggers

Composite DML triggers are subject to the following limits:

* `OLD`, `NEW`, and `PARENT` cannot appear in the declarative part, `BEFORE STATEMENT` part, or `AFTER STATEMENT` part.

* Only the `BEFORE EACH ROW` part can change the value of `NEW`.

* One time segment cannot handle the exceptions caused in another time segment.

* If a time segment contains the `GOTO` statement, the destination of the `GOTO` statement must be in the same time segment.

### Syntax for creating a composite trigger

In the declarative part (optional) of a composite trigger, you can declare the variables and subprograms that can be used by all time segments of the composite trigger. When the composite trigger fires, the declarative part runs before any time segment. The variables and subprograms exist in the time segments to which the trigger statement applies.

A composite trigger created on an uneditable view is not a real composite trigger because it has only one time segment. Syntax for creating a simple composite trigger on an uneditable view:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER FOR dml_event_clause ON view_name
COMPOUND TRIGGER
INSTEAD OF EACH ROW IS BEGIN
  sql_statement;
END INSTEAD OF EACH ROW;
```

A composite trigger created on a table or editable view contains at least one time segment. If a trigger contains multiple time segments, they can be sorted in any order but the points in time cannot be duplicated. If a time segment does not exist, no operation will be performed at this point in time.

The following table describes the time segments contained in a composite trigger.

| Time node | Time segment |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| Before the trigger statement runs  | BEFORE STATEMENT |
| After the trigger segment runs  | AFTER STATEMENT |
| Before each row affected by the trigger segment  | BEFORE EACH ROW |
| After each row affected by the trigger segment  | AFTER EACH ROW |

A composite trigger has no initialization part. However, `BEFORE STATEMENT` can perform any initialization as needed because it runs prior to other time segments.

If a composite trigger has neither the `BEFORE STATEMENT` part nor the `AFTER STATEMENT` part and its trigger statement does not affect any rows, this composite trigger will never fire.

Example: Use a composite trigger to record the changes in the child table of a table.  

```sql
  CREATE TABLE emp_salaries (
      emp_id NUMBER NOT NULL,
      change_date DATE   NOT NULL,
      salary NUMBER(8,2) NOT NULL,
      FOREIGN KEY (emp_id)
      REFERENCES employees (employee_id) ON DELETE CASCADE);

  sal  salaries_t;
  idx  SIMPLE_INTEGER := 0;

    sal(idx).salary := :NEW.salary;
