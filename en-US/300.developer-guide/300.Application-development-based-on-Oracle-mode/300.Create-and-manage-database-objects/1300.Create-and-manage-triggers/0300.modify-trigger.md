# Modify a trigger

You can use the REPLACE TRIGGER statement to modify a trigger. This topic describes how to modify a trigger.

## Syntax

To modify a trigger, you can use only the `REPLACE TRIGGER` statement, which is a DDL statement.

Generally, you can use the following syntax to create or modify a trigger:

```javascript
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trigger_name ...
```

> **Note**
>
> If the value of `trigger_name` does not exist, the trigger is created. If the value of `trigger_name` exists, the trigger is modified.

## Examples

1. View the trigger `DEL_NEW_REGION`.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT TRIGGER_BODY FROM USER_TRIGGERS WHERE TRIGGER_NAME='DEL_NEW_REGION'\G
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
   TRIGGER_BODY: TRIGGER del_new_region
         BEFORE DELETE ON regions
         FOR EACH ROW
         WHEN (old.region_id >3)
      BEGIN
         INSERT INTO reg_his(region_id , region_name )
              VALUES( :old.region_id, :old.region_name );
      END
   1 row in set
   ```

2. Modify the trigger `DEL_NEW_REGION`. Change the data deletion logic from `region_id >3` to `region_id >2` for the DEL_NEW_REGION trigger.

   ```unknow
   client> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER del_new_region
              BEFORE DELETE ON regions
              FOR EACH ROW
              WHEN (old.region_id >2)
           BEGIN
              INSERT INTO reg_his(region_id , region_name)
                   VALUES( :old.region_id, :old.region_name );
           END;
         /
   Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning
   ```

3. View the `DEL_NEW_REGION` trigger again.

   ```unknow
   client> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER del_new_region
             BEFORE DELETE ON regions
              FOR EACH ROW
              WHEN (old.region_id>2)
           BEGIN
              INSERT INTO reg_his(region_id , region_name )
                   VALUES( :old.region_id, :old.region_name );
           END;
         /
   Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning
   ```
