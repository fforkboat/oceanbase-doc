# Subqueries

A subquery is a query nested in an upper-layer query. The SQL language supports multi-level nested queries, which means that one subquery can be nested with other subqueries.

## Overview

A subquery is a query nested within another `SELECT` statement and can return one row, multiple rows, or nothing. A `SELECT` statement can be nested with one or more other SELECT statements. A subquery in the `FROM` clause of a `SELECT` statement is also called an inner join view. A subquery in the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` statement is also called a nested subquery.

### Subquery types

Subqueries can be divided into the following types based on the row and column numbers in the result set.

| Subquery types | Result sets | Clauses |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Scalar subquery | Single column and single row | <ul><li>`SELECT`</li><li> `WHERE`   </li><li> `HAVING` </li></ul> |
| Column subquery | Single column and multiple rows | <ul><li>`WHERE`</li><li> `HAVING`</li></ul> |
| Row subqueries | Multiple columns and multiple rows | <ul><li>`WHERE`</li><li> `HAVING`</li></ul> |
| Table subquery | Multiple rows and multiple columns | <ul><li>`FROM`</li><li> `EXISTS`</li></ul> |

### Scenarios

Subqueries are mainly used in the following scenarios:

* Define a row set to be inserted into the target table in the `INSERT` or `CREATE TABLE` statement.

* Define a row set to be included in a view in the `CREATE VIEW` statement.

* Define one or more values to be assigned to existing rows in the `UPDATE` statement.

* Provide values for the `WHERE`, `HAVING`, or `START WITH` clauses in the `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements.

### Keywords in subqueries

Subqueries can contain the following keywords: `IN`, `ANY`, `SOME`, and `ALL`.

* The `IN` keyword is frequently used in a `WHERE` expression to query data in a specified range.

* The `ANY` and `SOME` keywords can be used with operators such as `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `<>` to query data equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or equal to, or not equal to the specified data.

* The `ALL` keyword can be used with operators such as `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `<>` to specify values that are equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or equal to, or not equal to all the specified data.

> **Notice**
>
> If the `NOT IN` keyword is used and the column value in a subquery is `NULL`, the result of the outer query is empty.

## Examples

Create tables `emp_ny`, `dept_ny`, and `job_grades_ny`, and insert data to them.

1. Create the `dept_ny` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE dept_ny(
              deptno           NUMBER(2,0),
              dname            VARCHAR(14),
              location         VARCHAR(13),
              CONSTRAINT pk_dept PRIMARY KEY(deptno)
             );
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. Create the `job_grades_ny` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE job_grades_ny
             (
             grade_level VARCHAR(5),
             lowest_sal NUMBER,
             highest_sal NUMBER);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. Create the `emp_ny` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE emp_ny(
              empno         NUMBER(4,0),
              empname       VARCHAR(10),
              job           VARCHAR(9),
              mgr           NUMBER(4,0),
              hiredate      DATE,
              sal           NUMBER(7,2),
              comm          NUMBER(7,2),
              deptno        NUMBER(2,0),
              age           NUMBER(2,0),
              CONSTRAINT PK_emp PRIMARY KEY (empno),
              CONSTRAINT FK_deptno  FOREIGN KEY (deptno)  REFERENCES dept_ny (deptno)
              );
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

4. Insert data to the `dept_ny` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> INSERT INTO dept_ny VALUES
             (20,'Finance','beijing'),
             (35,'Administration','hangzhou'),
             (40,'Development','xian'),
             (30,'Workshop','guangzhou'),
             (25,'Legal affairs','shanghai'),
             (45,'Office','suzhou');
   Query OK, 6 rows affected
   Records: 6  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
   ```

5. Insert data to the `job_grades_ny` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> INSERT INTO job_grades_ny VALUES ('A', 1000, 1999),
             ('B', 2000, 2999),('C', 3000, 3999),('D', 40000, 4999),
             ('E', 5000, 5999);
   Query OK, 5 rows affected
   Records: 5  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
   ```

6. Insert data to the `emp_ny` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> INSERT INTO emp_ny VALUES
               (1369,'SMITH','CLERK',1902,DATE'1980-12-17',800.00,NULL,20,22),
               (1499,'ALLEN','SALESMAN',1698,DATE'1981-02-20',1600.00,300.00,35,22),
               (1566,'JONES','MANAGER',1839,DATE'1981-04-02',2975.00, NULL,40,22),
               (1698,'BLAKE' ,'MANAGER',1839,DATE'1981-05-01',2850.00,NULL ,30,33),
               (1788,'SCOTT','ANALYST',1566,DATE'1987-07-15',3000.00,NULL ,25,33),
               (1902,'FORD','ANALYST',1566,DATE'1981-12-05',3000.00, NULL,45,22);
   Query OK, 6 rows affected
   Records: 6  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
   ```

### A scalar subquery with a SELECT clause

Use a scalar subquery to obtain the number of employees in each department.

```sql
obclient> SELECT a.*,(SELECT count(*) FROM emp_ny b WHERE b.deptno = a.deptno) AS Number of employees FROM dept_ny a;
+--------+----------------+-----------+--------------+
| DEPTNO | DNAME          | LOCATION  | Number of employees     |
+--------+----------------+-----------+--------------+
|     20 | Finance        | beijing   |            1 |
|     25 | Legal affairs  | shanghai  |            1 |
|     30 | Workshop       | guangzhou |            1 |
|     35 | Administration | hangzhou  |            1 |
|     40 | Development    | xian      |            1 |
|     45 | Office         | suzhou    |            1 |
+--------+----------------+-----------+--------------+
6 rows in set
```

Use a scalar subquery to obtain the department that meets the condition `empno =1566`.

```sql
obclient> SELECT (SELECT a.dname FROM dept_ny a, emp_ny b WHERE a.deptno = b.deptno AND b.empno = 1566) AS Department name FROM emp_ny b;
+--------------+
| Department name     |
+--------------+
| Development  |
| Development  |
| Development  |
| Development  |
| Development  |
| Development  |
+--------------+
6 rows in set
```

### Subqueries with WHERE and HAVING clauses

#### Example 1: A scalar subquery

Use subqueries with `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses to obtain the IDs of departments whose minimum salary is greater than that of Department No.30 and to obtain the minimum salaries of these departments.

```sql
obclient> SELECT min(a.sal) minsalary,deptno FROM emp_ny a GROUP BY a.deptno
          HAVING min(a.sal) > (SELECT min(sal) FROM emp_ny WHERE deptno = 30);
+-----------+--------+
| MINSALARY | DEPTNO |
+-----------+--------+
|      3000 |     25 |
|      2975 |     40 |
|      3000 |     45 |
+-----------+--------+
3 rows in set
```

#### Example 2: A column subquery that returns a result set with one column and multiple rows

Use a column subquery to obtain the employee IDs, names, jobs, and salaries of employees whose `jobs` are not `MANAGER` and whose total salaries are lower than that of the manager.

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname Employee name, empno Employee ID, job Job, sal Salary FROM emp_ny
          WHERE sal < ALL
          (SELECT DISTINCT sal FROM emp_ny WHERE job = 'MANAGER') AND job!= 'MANAGER';
+--------------+--------------+----------+--------+
| Employee name     | Employee ID     | Job     | Salary    |
+--------------+--------------+----------+--------+
| SMITH        |         1369 | CLERK    |    800 |
| ALLEN        |         1499 | SALESMAN |   1600 |
+--------------+--------------+----------+--------+
2 rows in set
```

Use a column subquery with the aggregate function `min` to obtain the employee IDs, names, jobs, and salaries of the employees whose `jobs` are not `MANAGER` and whose total salaries are lower than that of the manager.

```sql
obclient> SELECT empname Employee name, empno Employee ID, job Job, sal Salary FROM emp_ny
          WHERE sal < ALL (SELECT min(sal) FROM emp_ny WHERE job = 'MANAGER') AND job!= 'MANAGER';
+--------------+--------------+----------+--------+
| Employee name     | Employee ID     | Job     | Salary    |
+--------------+--------------+----------+--------+
| SMITH        |         1369 | CLERK    |    800 |
| ALLEN        |         1499 | SALESMAN |   1600 |
+--------------+--------------+----------+--------+
2 rows in set
```

#### Example 3: A row subquery that returns a result set with one row and multiple columns

Use a row subquery to obtain the employee with the largest `empno` value and the highest salary.

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM emp_ny a
          WHERE a.empno = (SELECT max(empno) FROM emp_ny)
          AND sal = (SELECT max(sal) FROM emp_ny);
+-------+---------+---------+------+-----------+------+------+--------+------+
| EMPNO | EMPNAME | JOB     | MGR  | HIREDATE  | SAL  | COMM | DEPTNO | AGE  |
+-------+---------+---------+------+-----------+------+------+--------+------+
|  1902 | FORD    | ANALYST | 1566 | 05-DEC-81 | 3000 | NULL |     45 |   22 |
+-------+---------+---------+------+-----------+------+------+--------+------+
1 row in set
```

### EXISTS and related subqueries

In an `EXISTS` subquery, the main query is first executed to obtain a result, and then the result is filtered based on the conditions in the subquery. The subquery contains the fields that are used in the main query. Therefore, the subquery is called a related subquery. The query result of `EXISTS` is 1 or 0, which indicates whether the result set of the subquery contains values. An `EXISTS` subquery can be replaced with an `IN` clause.

#### Example 1

Use an `EXISTS` clause to query the `DNAME` data in the `dept_ny` table, which has the same `deptno` values in the `emp_ny` table as in the dept_ny table.

```sql
obclient> SELECT dname FROM dept_ny a WHERE EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM emp_ny b WHERE a.deptno = b.deptno);
+----------------+
| DNAME          |
+----------------+
| Finance        |
| Legal affairs  |
| Workshop       |
| Administration |
| Development    |
| Office         |
+----------------+
6 rows in set
```

Use the keyword IN to query the `DNAME` data in the `dept_ny` table, which has the same `deptno` values in the `emp_ny` table as in the dept_ny table.

```sql
obclient> SELECT dname FROM dept_ny a WHERE a.deptno IN (SELECT deptno FROM emp_ny);
+----------------+
| DNAME          |
+----------------+
| Finance        |
| Legal affairs  |
| Workshop       |
| Administration |
| Development    |
| Office         |
+----------------+
6 rows in set
```
