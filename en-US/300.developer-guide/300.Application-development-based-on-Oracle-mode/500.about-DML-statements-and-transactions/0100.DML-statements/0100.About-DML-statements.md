# About DML statements

You can use DML statements to manipulate data of objects in a schema, for example, to add, modify, and delete data.

## Introduction

As the most frequently used SQL statements, DML statements can be used to modify data.

The following DML statements are available:

* [INSERT statement](02.About-INSERT-statements.md): inserts a row or query results into a table or view.

* [UPDATE statement](03.About-UPDATE-statements.md): updates column values in rows of a table or view.

* [MERGE statement](04.About-MERGE-statements.md): determines whether to use the `INSERT` statement or `UPDATE` statement based on conditions.

* [DELETE statement](05.About-DELETE-statements.md): deletes rows from a table or view.

## Examples

Execute the following statement to create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer (cust_id int primary key,cust_name varchar(8),note varchar(512));
```

Execute the following DML statements to modify the table:

* Execute the `INSERT INTO` statement to insert a row into the customer table.

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO customer VALUES(11,'Tom','Jacy');
   ```

* Execute the `UPDATE` statement to update a row in the customer table.

   ```sql
   UPDATE customer SET cust_name = 'Tomy' WHERE cust_id = 11;
   ```

* Run the `MERGE` command to insert data of the customer table into the t_merge table.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE t_merge (cust_id int primary key,cust_name varchar(8),note varchar(512));

   MERGE INTO t_merge t2
     USING (SELECT cust_id,cust_name,note FROM customer) t1
     ON (t2.cust_id=t1.cust_id)
     WHEN MATCHED THEN
        UPDATE SET t2.cust_name=t1.cust_name, t2.note=t1.note
     WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
        INSERT (t2.cust_id,t2.cust_name,t2.note) values(t1.cust_id, t1.cust_name, t1.note);
   ```

* Execute the `DELETE` statement to delete the data that meets the specified condition.

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM customer WHERE cust_id = 11;
   ```

## Relationship between DML statements and transactions

A transaction is a set of DML statements that make up a logical work unit. The following example helps you better understand what a transaction is: If money is transferred from Account A to Account B, three operations are involved. First, the balance in Account A decreases. Second, the balance in Account B increases. Third, the transfer is recorded in the transfer history tables of the accounts. These three operations can be collectively called a transaction.

A change made by a DML statement is persisted only when the transaction is committed. A transaction is a set of SQL statements that OceanBase Database treats as a unit. Either all of the statements are executed, or none of them are. A DML statement can also be a transaction.
