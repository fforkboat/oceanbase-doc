# Commit a transaction

Committing a transaction will persist all changes made in the transaction, delete the savepoints, and release all locks held by the transaction. This topic describes how to commit a transaction.

## Syntax

In OceanBase Database, transactions can be committed explicitly or implicitly. To explicitly commit a transaction, use the `COMMIT` statement or the commit button (on a GUI-based client). To implicitly commit a transaction, you do not need to proactively commit it. When `autocommit` is set to 1, after each statement is executed, OceanBase Database will automatically commit the transaction where this statement is executed. A statement is a transaction.

> **Note**
>
> OceanBase Database issues an implicit `COMMIT` statement before and after a DDL statement, which also commits a transaction.

* If you use the `BEGIN` statement to start a new transaction, you must use the `COMMIT` statement to commit the transaction after you execute a DML statement.

   * Before you commit a transaction, your changes take effect only for the current session and not for other database sessions. These changes are not persisted and therefore not the final result. You can use the `ROLLBACK` statement to roll back the changes.

   * After you commit the transaction, your changes take effect for all database sessions. After your changes are persisted, you cannot roll them back with a `ROLLBACK` statement.

   > **Note**
   >
   > If the repeatable read isolation level is set for the transaction, sessions where the transaction is started cannot query newly committed data.


* If transactions are started implicitly (autocommit set to 1), each SQL statement is a transaction. In this case, you do not need to proactively commit the entire transaction. After the SQL statement is executed, your changes are persisted, and you cannot roll them back with a `ROLLBACK` statement.

## Examples

### Commit a transaction explicitly

Use `BEGIN` to start a transaction, use `INSERT` to insert data into the `t_insert` table, and then use `COMMIT` to commit the transaction. Log out from the database and then log on again. Verify that the data is correctly inserted and successfully saved.

```sql
obclient> BEGIN;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t_insert(id,name) VALUES(4,'JP');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> exit;

$obclient -h192.168.0.0 -utpcc@obbmsql#obdemo -P2883 -p******  TPCC
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
+----+------+-------+------------+
| ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE |
+----+------+-------+------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10001 | 01-JAN-70  |
|  2 | US   | 10002 | 01-JAN-70  |
|  3 | EN   | 10003 | 01-JAN-70  |
|  4 | JP   |  NULL | 01-JAN-70  |
+----+------+-------+------------+
4 rows in set
```

### Commit a transaction implicitly

Set `autocommit` to 1 to enable the autocommit mode.

```sql
obclient> SET autocommit=1;

obclient> INSERT INTO t_insert(id,name) VALUES(4,'JP');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> exit;

$obclient -h192.168.0.0 -utpcc@obbmsql#obdemo -P2883 -p******  TPCC
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
+----+------+-------+------------+
| ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE |
+----+------+-------+------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10001 | 01-JAN-70  |
|  2 | US   | 10002 | 01-JAN-70  |
|  3 | EN   | 10003 | 01-JAN-70  |
|  4 | JP   |  NULL | 01-JAN-70  |
+----+------+-------+------------+
4 rows in set
```
