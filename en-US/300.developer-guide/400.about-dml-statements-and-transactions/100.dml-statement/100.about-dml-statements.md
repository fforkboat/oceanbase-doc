# About DML statements

You can use DML statements to manipulate data of objects in a schema, for example, to add, modify, and delete data.

## Introduction

As the most frequently used SQL statements, DML statements can be used to modify data.

The following DML statements are available:

* [INSERT statement](../100.dml-statement/200.insert-statement.md): inserts a row or query results into a table or view.

* [UPDATE statement](../100.dml-statement/300.about-update-statements.md): updates column values in rows of a table or view.

* [DELETE statement](../100.dml-statement/400.about-the-delete-statement.md): deletes rows from a table or view.

* [REPLACE INTO statement](../100.dml-statement/500.replace-into-statements.md): inserts or replaces data in a table.

## Examples

Execute the following statement to create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer (cust_id int primary key,cust_name varchar(8),note varchar(512));
```

Execute the following DML statements to modify the table:

* Execute the `INSERT INTO` statement to insert a row into the customer table.

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO customer VALUES(11,'Tom','Jacy');
   ```

* Execute the `UPDATE` statement to update a row in the customer table.

   ```sql
   UPDATE customer SET cust_name = 'Tomy' WHERE cust_id = 11;
   ```

* Execute the `DELETE` statement to delete the data that meets the specified condition.

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM customer WHERE cust_id = 11;
   ```

* Use `REPLACE INTO` to insert data.

   ```sql
   REPLACE INTO customer VALUES(11,'Tom','Lucy');
   ```

## Relationship between DML statements and transactions

A transaction is a set of DML statements that make up a logical work unit. The following example helps you better understand what a transaction is: If money is transferred from Account A to Account B, three operations are involved. First, the balance in Account A decreases. Second, the balance in Account B increases. Third, the transfer is recorded in the transfer history tables of the accounts. These three operations can be collectively called a transaction.

A change made by a DML statement is persisted only when the transaction is committed. A transaction is a set of SQL statements that OceanBase Database treats as a unit. Either all of the statements are executed, or none of them are. A DML statement can also be a transaction.
