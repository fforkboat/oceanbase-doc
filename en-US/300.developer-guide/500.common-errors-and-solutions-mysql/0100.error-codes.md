# About error codes

This topic describes the error messages for MySQL tenants in OceanBase Database.

## Format of error messages

OceanBase Database is highly compatible with MySQL. Specifically, OceanBase Database is compatible with general MySQL features, foreground and background MySQL protocols, as well as some native error codes of MySQL. Therefore, the error message format for MySQL tenants in OceanBase Database is the same as that in MySQL databases.

Format of error messages:

```sql
ERROR <err_num> (<sql_stat>) : err_msg
```

Parameters

* `err_num`: the error code.

* `sql_stat`: the SQL state.

* `err_msg`: the error message.

## Variables in error messages

In OceanBase Database, variables are embedded in error messages to help you troubleshoot issues. In this topic, these variables are represented by percent signs (%).

Examples:

```sql
ERROR 4626 (HY000) : resource pool '%s' has already been granted to a tenant
```

The preceding error message may appear as the following message:

```sql
ERROR 4626 (HY000) : resource pool 'pool1' has already been granted to a tenant
```
