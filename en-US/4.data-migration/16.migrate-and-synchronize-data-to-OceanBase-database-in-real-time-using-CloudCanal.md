# 4.13 Use CloudCanal to migrate and synchronize data to OceanBase Database in real time

## Introduction

CloudCanal Community Edition is a free data migration and synchronization platform released by [ClouGence](https://www.clougence.com). This platform provides a rich variety of features, including schema migration, full data migration, verification, revision, and real-time incremental data synchronization. The product offers a complete set of productized capabilities, helping enterprises break down data silos and realize data integration and interoperability, so as to better use data.

In addition to its complete set of productized capabilities, CloudCanal also allows users to add data sources and create tasks in a visualized interface to implement automatic schema migration, full data migration, and real-time incremental data synchronization. This topic describes how to migrate and synchronize data from a MySQL database to an OceanBase database. You can also use CloudCanal to migrate data from other sources, such as Oracle or PostgreSQL databases, to OceanBase Database in a similar way.

### Prerequisites

You have installed and deployed CloudCanal Community Edition. For information about how to install and deploy CloudCanal Community Edition, see [CloudCanal Community Edition installation and deployment guide](https://www.askcug.com/topic/75).

### Add a data source

- Log on to the CloudCanal platform.
- Choose **Manage Data Sources** > **Add Data Source**.
- Set **Deployment Type** to **Self-managed Database**, and select **OceanBase** for **Database Type**.

### Create a task

After you add a data source, perform the following steps to create a data migration and synchronization task:

- Choose **Manage Tasks** > **Create Task**.
- Specify the ****source database and the ****destination database.
- Click **Next**.

- Select a subscribed table. Tables automatically created during schema migration are mapped based on the default type. If the peer table has been created in advance, you can also directly map the table to the existing table on the peer side.
- Click **Next**.

- Configure column mapping.
- Click **Next**.

> Tips: If the table is automatically created during schema migration by using CloudCanal, it cannot be renamed or pruned, and its columns cannot be mapped. If the table is mapped to a table that has been created in advance on the peer end, column pruning and mapping are allowed.
