# Migrate data and resource units between tables 

This topic describes how to use SQL scripts to migrate data and resource units between tables. 

Migrate data between tables 
------------------------------------------------

You can use the `INSERT INTO......SELECT` statement to synchronize data between tables. 

The following statement inserts data from table_A to table_B:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_B
SELECT col1,col2 from table_A
WHERE [expr];
```



Migrate resource units 
-------------------------------------------

The following statement migrates a resource unit of the specified unit ID to the destination:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM MIGRATE
UNIT = [unit_id] DESTINATION = [ip_port]
```



The following statement cancels a resource unit migration task:

```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL MIGRATE UNIT unit_id;
```
