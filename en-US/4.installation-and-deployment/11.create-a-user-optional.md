Create a user (optional) 
=============================================



If you are an individual user, you can use Oceanbase Database as the root user and skip this topic. If you are an enterprise user, we recommend that you create non-root users for the servers to ensure data security. You can create frequently used users as needed. 
**Note**



You must perform this operation on each server.

The following example shows how to create an admin user. 

* Run the following command to create the admin user: 

  ```bash
  useradd -U admin -d /home/admin -s /bin/bash
  mkdir -p /home/admin
  sudo chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
  ```

  

* Run the following command to set a password for the admin user: 

  ```unknow
  passwd admin
  ```

  

* Optional. Set sudo permissions for the admin user. 

  Run the following command to open the sudoers file in the `/etc/` directory: In the sudoers file, add the following codes:

  ```bash
  ## Same thing without a password
  # %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
  admin       ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
  ```

  

* Run the following command to view the directory access permission: 

  ```bash
  ls --al
  ```

  

  The following information is returned:

  ```unknow
  drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 Feb 9 18:43 
  drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 Feb 18:43 log1
  ```

  

  If the admin user does not have the access permission, run the following command as the root user:

  ```unknow
  chown -R admin:admin /data
  chown -R admin:admin /redo
  chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
  ```

  

  Note that you need to specify your actual mount directories. The `/data`, `/redo`, and `/home/admin` directories in the preceding example command is provided for your information only.
