Build OceanBase Database by using source code 
==================================================================

This topic describes how to build OceanBase Database by using source code and test the latest features. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

Before you start, make sure that the following requirements are met:

* Operating system: CentOS 7 or 8 (x86 architecture)

  

* Number of servers: 1

  

* Minimum hardware specifications:

  

* Recommended hardware specifications:

  




Get the source code 
----------------------------------------

Run the following command to clone the source code repository of OceanBase Database to your target server:

```shell
git clone git@${GIT_MIRROR_ADDRESS}/oceanbase/oceanbase
```


**Notice**



To clone the repository, you must install Git first. For more information, see [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

Get build dependencies 
-------------------------------------------

You can get the build dependencies through the following options:

* **Option 1: Get dependencies from a yum repository (recommended).**

  




You can get most of the required tools and libraries from public yum repositories and the official yum repository of OceanBase Database. If your operating system supported, you can use the predefined scripts to download the corresponding packages and build the database faster.

Step 1. Install necessary tools

Run the following command to prepare necessary tools:

```bash
yum install wget rpm* cpio make glibc-devel glibc-headers
```



Step 2. Run the following command to verify whether your compiler has access to the official YUM repository of OceanBase Database.

```shell
curl http://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/OceanBase.repo
```



Step 3. If yes, run the initialization script to download the build dependencies

```shell
# Enter the root directory of the code
cd oceanbase

# Run the build.sh script and set the init parameter.
sh build.sh init
```





* **Option 2: Compile the dependencies on your own** 

  You can also compile the dependencies in the `deps/3rd` directory on your own. The following table describes programs required for compiling dependencies.

Build and package OceanBase Database 
---------------------------------------------------------

OceanBase Database is built using CMake. You can run CMake commands to create a directory and build it, or use the `build.sh` script to build it through predefined options:

* Build the debug version

  ```shell
  # Run the predefined command for building the debug version in the source code directory.
  sh build.sh debug
  
  # Enter the generated directory for building the debug version.
  cd build_debug
  
  # Start building.
  make -j{N} observer
  
  # Check the product.
  stat src/observer/observer
  ```

  

* Build the release version

  ```shell
  # Run the predefined command for building the release version in the source code directory.
  sh build.sh release
  
  # Enter the generated directory for building the release edition.
  cd build_release
  
  # Start building.
  make -j{N} observer
  
  # Check the product.
  stat src/observer/observer
  ```

  

* Create the RPM package

  ```shell
  # Run the predefined command for creating the RPM package in the source code directory.
  sh build.sh rpm
  
  # Enter the generated RPM package directory.
  cd build_rpm
  
  # Build dependencies for the RPM package
  make -j{N} rpm
  
  # Check the product.
  stat *rpm
  ```

  



**Note**



To speed up the building process, you can specify the `-j` parameter to proceed in parallel. We recommend that you set the number of concurrent threads `N` to min(CPU(core)\*2, memory (GB)/2).

Options

The following table describes options for building OceanBase Database.


|         **Option**         |     **Default value**     |                                                   **Category**                                                    |

Subsequent operations 
------------------------------------------

After OceanBase Database build is completed, you can use OceanBase Deployer (OBD) to deploy it. For more information, see [Use OBD to deploy OceanBase Database](../2.quick-start/4.use-obd-to-deploy-oceanbase-database.md).
