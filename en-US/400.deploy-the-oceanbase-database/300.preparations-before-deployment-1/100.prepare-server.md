# Prepare servers

In a minimum deployment, you typically need three OBServers to deploy an OceanBase cluster and a separate server to install OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) to manage the OceanBase cluster.

An OceanBase cluster consists of at least three nodes, each of which runs an observer process. Multiple observer processes on different nodes form a cluster to provide services to users.

The following table describes the minimum configuration requirements of the servers.

| **Server type** | **Quantity** | **Minimum functional configuration** | **Minimum performance configuration** |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| OCP server | 1 | 32 CPU cores, 128 GB of memory, and 1.5 TB of storage space <blockquote><b>Note</b></br>This configuration includes resources required for OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT) and OceanBase Developer Center (ODC). | 32 CPU cores, 128 GB of memory, 1.5 TB of SSD space, and 10 Gbit/s NIC <blockquote><b>Note</b></br>This configuration includes resources required for OAT and ODC. |
| OBServer | 3 | 8 CPU cores, 64 GB of memory, and 1.2 TB of storage space  | 32 CPU cores, 256 GB of memory, 2 TB of SSD space, and 10 Gbit/s NIC |
| OBProxy server | 3 (OBServers can be reused) | 4 CPU cores, 8 GB of memory, and 200 GB of storage space | N/A |
| OAT deployment server | 1 (OCP server can be reused) | <ul><li> x86_64 architecture: 8 CPU cores and 16 GB of memory</li> <li> AArch64 architecture: 8 CPU cores and 16 GB of memory</li></ul> | N/A |
| OMS Docker deployment server (optional) | 1 | 12 CPU cores, 24 GB of memory, and 500 GB of storage space | 32 CPU cores, 128 GB of memory, and 2 TB of storage space |
| ODC Docker deployment server (optional) | 1 (OCP server can be reused) | 2 CPU cores and 4 GB of memory | 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory |

> **Note**
>
> * For OCP to provide high availability, you can deploy three OCP servers and install the load balancing hardware or software (F5 or SLB) or the ob_dns component provided by OceanBase.
> * OceanBase Database V4.0 allows you to deploy OceanBase Database on a server with 4 CPU cores and 16 GB of memory.
