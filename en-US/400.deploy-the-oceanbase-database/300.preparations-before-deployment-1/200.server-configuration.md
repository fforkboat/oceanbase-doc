# Configure servers

This topic describes the hardware and software requirements for configuring servers.

## Prepare the operating system

Prepare your operation system as required by the following table.

| Linux operating system | Version | Server architecture |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| AliOS | 7.2 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (supporting only Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux | 7.2 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (supporting only Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| SUSE Enterprise Linux | 12 SP3 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (supporting only Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| Debian or Ubuntu | 8.3 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (supporting only Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| KylinOS | V10 | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (supporting only Kunpeng and Phytium) |

> **Note**
>
> Be sure to configure the network and software manager (Yum or Zypper) for the operating system.

## Configure BIOS settings

Configure the following special settings:

* Disable non-uniform memory access (NUMA) for Intel.

* Enable NUMA for Hygon, AMD, Kunpeng, and Arm.

Disable the following BIOS options:

* C-State

* P-State

* EIST

* Power saving

* Turbo mode

Enable the following BIOS options:

* Automatic Power on After Power Loss: Always on

* Intel Virtualization Technology: on

* SOL Console Redirection: on

* Hyper-Threading: on

* Hardware prefetcher: on

* VT-d: on

* SR-IOV: on

* Energy Performance: Maximum Performance

> **Note**
>
> The method for configuring BIOS settings varies from server to server. For details, see the operation manual of your server.

## Mount disks

* Mount disks for an OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) server as required by the following table.

   | Mounting point | Size | Description | Disk format |
   |------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|
   | /home | 100 GB to 300 GB | Operation log disk for OCP components | ext4 (recommended) |
   | /data/log1 | 3 to 4 times the memory size | OCP MetaDB log disk | ext4 (recommended) |
   | /data/1 | Depends on the size of data to be stored | OCP MetaDB data disk | ext4 (recommended). If the data size is greater than 16 TB, XFS is recommended. |
   | /docker | 200 GB to 500 GB | Docker root directory | ext4 (recommended) |

* Mount disks for an OBServer as required by the following table.

   | Mounting point | Size | Description | File system format |
   |------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
   | /home | 100 GB to 300 GB | OBServer operation log disk | ext4 (recommended) |
   | /data/log1 | 3 to 4 times the memory size | OBServer log disk | ext4 (recommended) |
   | /data/1 | Depends on the size of data to be stored | OBServer data disk | ext4 (recommended). If the data size is greater than 16 TB, XFS is recommended. |

* Mount disks for an OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) server as required by the following table.

   | Mounting point | Size | Description | File system format |
   |-----------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------|
   | /data/oms | About 400 GB (Depends on the size of synchronization objects, the number of synchronization tasks, the frequency of DML operations on the synchronization objects, and the retention time of stores) | Data disk for OMS Store components | ext4 (recommended) |

> **Note**
>
> It is recommended that the root directory be no less than 50 GB and that the `/opt` and `/var` directories not be mounted separately. If you use Logical Volume Manager (LVM), we recommend that you specify the stripe parameters when creating directories. An example is as follows:
>
> ```shell
> lvcreate -n data -L 3000G obvg --stripes=3 --stripesize=128
> ```

## Configure NIC settings

It is recommended that you configure two 10 Gbit/s NICs, as follows:

* Name the bond mode bond0, mode1, or mode4 (recommended). If you use mode4, you must configure 802.3ad for the vSwitch.
* Name the two NICs eth0 and eth1 respectively.
* Use network service, not NetworkManager.

## Install Docker CE 17.03 or later

Install Docker CE 17.03 or later on servers where OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT), OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), and OMS are deployed.
