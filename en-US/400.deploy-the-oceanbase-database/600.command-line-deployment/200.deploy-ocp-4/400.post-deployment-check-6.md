# Check after deployment
# docslug#/oceanbase-database/oceanbase-database/V3.2.3/post-deployment-check-6
After you deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you can log on to the OCP console to check if everything is ok.

The GUI varies with the OCP version. This topic takes OCP V3.3.2 as an example.

## Log on to the OCP console

1. Enter the OCP access address in the address bar of your browser and press the **Enter** key.

   The access address is in the format of http://<*OCP server IP address*>:8080.

2. On the logon page, enter the default account `admin`.

   > **Note**
   >
   > * If you want to access OCP by using a domain name, you must configure the domain name resolution service for the local host.
   > * Contact OceanBase Technical Support to obtain the default password of the admin account. To ensure account security, change the password after the first logon.

## Check MetaDB cluster information

3. In the **Clusters** section of the **Clusters** page, find the MetaDB cluster and click its name. On the **Overview** page of the cluster, check whether the basic information, resource usage, zone list, and OBServer list of the MetaDB are correct.

## Check the monitoring status

In the left-side navigation pane of the **Clusters** page, click **Performance Monitoring**. On the **Performance Monitoring** page of the cluster, check whether the database performance and host performance curves are normal.
