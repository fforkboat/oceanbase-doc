# Check after deployment

After you deploy OceanBase Migration Service (OMS), you can log on to the OMS console to check if everything is ok.

## Background

The GUI varies with the OMS version. This topic takes OMS V1.4.3 as an example. For other OMS versions, see User Guide of the corresponding version.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS console through its access address.

   The access address is in the format of http://<*OMS server IP address*>:8089.

2. On the logon page, enter the default account `admin`.

   > **Note**
   >
   > Contact OceanBase Technical Support to obtain the default password of the admin account. To ensure account security, change the password after the first logon.
