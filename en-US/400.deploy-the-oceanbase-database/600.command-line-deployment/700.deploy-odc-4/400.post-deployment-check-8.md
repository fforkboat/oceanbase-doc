# Check after deployment

After you deploy OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), you can log on to ODC to check if everything is ok.

The GUI varies with the ODC version. This topic takes ODC V2.3.0 as an example. For other ODC versions, see User Guide of the corresponding version.

## Log on to ODC

1. Log on to ODC from its access address.

   The access address is in the format of http://<*IP address of the ODC server*>:8989.

2. On the logon page, enter the default account `admin`.

   > Note
   >
   > Contact OceanBase Technical Support to obtain the default password of the admin account. To ensure account security, change the password after the first logon.

## Connect to OceanBase Database by using ODC

1. After you log on to ODC, click **Create Connection** to go to the **Create Connection** page.

2. On the **Create Connection** page, you must specify the following information. If you have an OceanBase Database connection string, all the following information can be obtained from the connection string (`mysql -h `**`Host name `**`-P `**`Port number `**`-u `**`Database username@Tenant name`**`#`**`Cluster name`**`-D `**`Default database`**`-p`**`'Database password`**). Alternatively, you can use the smart parser provided on the page to fill in the information.

   | Parameter | Note |
   |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Region | Select the region where the connected instance is located. You can select **Public Cloud** if your database instance is deployed on Alibaba Cloud, or **Private Cloud** if your database instance is deployed in your own environment. |
   | Connection Mode | Select **MySQL** or **Oracle**. |
   | Connection Name | Specify the name of the connection.  |
   | Endpoint | **Host Name**: Obtain the host name from the tenant information page. **Port Number**: Obtain the port number from the tenant information page. **Cluster**: Enter the name of the cluster where the database to be connected is located. **Tenant**: Enter the name of the tenant to which the database to be connected belongs. |
   | Default Database (optional) | When you connect ODC to a database in a MySQL tenant, you can choose to specify a default database for the connection. This parameter does not need to be specified when you connect ODC to a database in an Oracle tenant.  |
   | Database Username | An account under the tenant. In MySQL mode, this account must have the privilege to access the default database.  |
   | Database Password | The password of the account under the tenant. You can click **Test Connection** after the password box to test whether you can connect to the target database. An error will be reported if the configuration information such as the username, password, or network settings are invalid. You can connect only to a database under the current tenant. Otherwise, a test failure error will be returned. |
   | Intelligent Parsing | Paste the connection string information. Then, ODC automatically recognizes and fills in the connection information.  |
   | SQL Query Timeout Value | Click **Advanced Configuration** in the lower part of the page to display this item. You can specify a timeout value for SQL queries. A query whose execution time exceeds the timeout value is automatically terminated. The default timeout value is 60 seconds. |
   | Query sys Tenant View | Click **Advanced Configuration** in the lower part of the page to display this item. **Account**: The account that has the permission to view the sys tenant view. **Password**: The password of the account. After you enter the account and password, click **Test Connection** next to the password box to verify whether the account information is valid. For ODC V2.3.0 and later versions, you need to configure the root account if you want to import and export data and view the partition information. |

   * Click <b>Save</b> in the lower part of the page to persist your configuration information in the ODC connection list. Next time you log on to ODC, you can directly select the connection from the list. The connection configuration does not necessarily need to pass the connection test when you save the configuration.

   * In the lower part of the page, ODC also provides the <b>Copy Connection String</b> button. When you click the button, ODC copies the current connection information as a connection string, which is easy for you to obtain the connection information. </li>

   * If you do not need to save the current connection configuration, click <b>Cancel</b>. Then, ODC displays a confirmation dialog box about whether to exit the **Create Connection** page.
