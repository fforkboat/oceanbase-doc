# OceanBase cluster deployment solutions

OceanBase Database uses a shared-nothing architecture with multiple replicas to ensure zero single point of failure (SPOF) and system continuity. It supports high availability (HA) and disaster recovery at the node, IDC, and region levels. You can deploy OceanBase Database in a single IDC or in five IDCs across three regions.



## Deployment solutions

### Solution 1: Three IDCs in the same region

**Characteristics**

* Three IDCs in the same region form a cluster with three replicas. Each IDC is a zone, with network latency ranging from 0.5ms to 2ms.
* If an IDC fails, the remaining two replicas are still in the majority. They can enable redo log synchronization and guarantee a recovery point objective (RPO) of zero.
* This deployment solution cannot cope with city-wide disasters.

### Solution 2: Five IDCs across three regions

**Characteristics**

* Five IDCs across three regions form a cluster with five replicas.
* In the case of an IDC or city-wide failure, the remaining replicas are still in the majority and can guarantee an RPO of zero.
* The majority must contain at least three replicas. However, each city has at most two replicas. To reduce the latency for synchronizing redo logs, Region1 and Region2 must be close to each other.
* To reduce costs, you can deploy only log replicas in Region3.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The "Three IDCs in the same region" and "Five IDCs across three regions" deployment solutions impose high requirements on infrastructure. To reuse the existing infrastructure of enterprise users, OceanBase Database provides two additional deployment solutions: two IDCs in the same region and three IDCs across two regions. </p>
