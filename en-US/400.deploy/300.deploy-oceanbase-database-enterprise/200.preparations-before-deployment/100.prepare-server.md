# Prepare servers

To ensure high availability and disaster recovery, an OceanBase cluster needs at least three servers, each with an observer process. These processes across different servers work together to provide services to external users.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>To ensure high availability of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) services, deploy OCP on three nodes and use a hardware- or software-based load balancer such as F5, Server Load Balancer (SLB), or Network Load Balancer (NLB) of OceanBase Database.</li>
    <li>For a minimum deployment of OceanBase Database V4.0.0, deploy the OceanBase cluster on one OBServer node and install OCP on a separate server dedicated to managing the OceanBase cluster.</li>
    </ul>
  </main>

The following table describes the minimum configuration requirements of the servers.

| **Server type** | **Quantity**                         | **Minimum functional configuration** | **Minimum performance configuration** |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) server | 1                                    | 8 CPU cores, 32 GB of memory, and 1.5 TB of storage space. This configuration includes resources required for OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT) and OceanBase Developer Center (ODC). | 32 CPU cores, 128 GB of memory, 1.5 TB of SSD space, and 10 Gbit/s NIC. This configuration includes resources required for OAT and ODC. |
| OBServer | 3                                    | 4 CPU cores, 16 GB of memory, and 1.2 TB of storage space | 32 CPU cores, 256 GB of memory, 2 TB of SSD storage, and 10 Gbit/s NIC |
| ODP server | 3. <br>You can also use the OBServer node as the ODP server. | 4 CPU cores, 8 GB of memory, and 200 GB of storage space | N/A |
| OAT deployment server | 1. <br>You can also use the OCP server as the OAT deployment server.     | 2 CPU cores and 4 GB of memory | N/A |
| (Optional) OMS Docker deployment server | 1                                    | 12 CPU cores, 24 GB of memory, and 500 GB of storage space | 32 CPU cores, 128 GB of memory, and 2 TB of storage space |
| (Optional) ODC Docker deployment server | 1. <br>You can also use the OCP server as the ODC Docker deployment server.     | 2 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory | 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory |
