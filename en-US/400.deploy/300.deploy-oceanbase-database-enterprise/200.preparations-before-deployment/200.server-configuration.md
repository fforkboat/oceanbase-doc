# Configure servers

This topic describes how to configure your servers.

## Step 1: Check your operating system

The following table lists the Linux operating systems that support OceanBase Database.

| Operating system | Version | Server architecture |
|--------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| AliOS | V7.2 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (such as Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| AnolisOS | V8.6 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (such as Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| KylinOS | V10 | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (such as Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| Unity Operating System (UOS) | V20 | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (such as Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| NFSChina | V4.0 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (such as Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| Inspur KOS | V5.8 | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (such as Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux | V7.2 and later <blockquote><b>Note</b></br> CentOS V8.X is not supported. </blockquote> | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (such as Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| SUSE Enterprise Linux Server    | 12 SP3 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (only Kunpeng and Phytium are supported) |
| Debian              | V8.3 and later  | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (only Kunpeng and Phytium are supported) |

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Before you use an operating system, configure the network and install a package manager such as YUM or Zypper first. </p>
  </main>

## Step 2: Set BIOS

Complete the following BIOS settings according to the operating system you selected.

**Special settings**

* For Intel-based operating systems, disable non-uniform memory access (NUMA).
  Additionally, we recommend that you run the following commands to set the `vm.swappiness` parameter in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file to `0`.

   >
   > ```bash
   > [root@xxx /]
   > $vi /etc/sysctl.conf
   > vm.swappiness = 0
   >
   > [root@xxx /]
   > $sysctl -p    #Use the values configured in the sysctl.conf configuration file.
   > ```

* For Hygon, AMD, Kunpeng, and AArch64 operating systems, enbale NUMA.
  Additionally, we recommend that you run the following commands to set the `kernel.numa_balancing`, `vm.zone_reclaim_mode`, and `vm.swappiness` parameters in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file to `0` for AArch64 and Hygon environments.

   >
   > ```bash
   > [root@xxx /]
   > $vi /etc/sysctl.conf
   > kernel.numa_balancing = 0
   > vm.zone_reclaim_mode = 0
   > vm.swappiness = 0
   >
   > [root@xxx /]
   > $sysctl -p    #Use the values configured in the sysctl.conf configuration file.
   >
   >

**Other settings**

* Disable the following BIOS options: C-State, P-State, EIST, Power saving, and Turbo mode.

* Configure the following BIOS options:

  * Automatic Power on After Power Loss: Always on

  * Intel Virtualization Technology: Enable

  * Hyper-Threading: Enable

  * Hardware prefetcher: Enable

  * VT-d: Enable

  * SR-IOV: Enable

  * Energy/Performance Bias: Maximum Performance

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The method for modifying BIOS settings varies depending on servers. Refer to your server's operation manual for specific steps. </p>
  </main>

## Step 3: Mount disks

Mount your disks according to the following requirements.

* Mounting point requirements on an OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) server

   | Mounting point | Size | Description | Disk format |
   |------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|
   | /home | 100 GB to 300 GB | The operation log disk of the components. | Ext4 is recommended. |
   | /data/log1 | 3 to 4 times the memory size | The log disk of the OCP MetaDB. | Ext4 is recommended. |
   | /data/1 | Depends on the size of data to be stored | The data disk of the OCP MetaDB. | Ext4 is recommended. If the size of the data disk is greater than 16 TB, XFS is recommended. |
   | /docker | 200 GB to 500 GB | The docker root directory. | Ext4 is recommended. |

* Mounting point requirements on an OBServer node

   | Mounting point | Size | Description | File system format |
   |------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
   | /home | 100 GB to 300 GB | The operation log disk of the observer process. | Ext4 is recommended. |
   | /data/log1 | 3 to 4 times the memory size | The log disk of the observer process. | Ext4 is recommended. |
   | /data/1 | Depends on the size of data to be stored | The data disk of the observer process. | Ext4 is recommended. If the size of the data disk is greater than 16 TB, XFS is recommended. |

* Mounting point requirement on an OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) server

   | Mounting point | Size | Description | File system format |
   |-----------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------|
   | /data/oms | 400 GB. The disk size depends on the size of the objects to be synchronized, the number of synchronization tasks, the frequency of DML operations on the synchronization objects, and the retention period of the Store components. | The data disk for OMS Store components. | Ext4 is recommended. |

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>We recommend that you allocate at least 50 GB for a root directory and do not separately mount the /opt and /var directories. If you use Logical Volume Manager (LVM), we recommend that you specify the stripe parameters during the creation of directories. Example:</p>
    <p><code></code><code>shell lvcreate -n data -L 3000G obvg --stripes=3 --stripesize=128 &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</code></p>
  </main>

## Step 4: Configure your NICs

We recommend that you configure two 10 Gbit/s NICs for optimal performance.

* You can name the bond mode as bond0, mode1, or mode4, where mode4 is recommended. If you use mode4, you must configure 802.3ad for the vSwitch.
* We recommend that you name the NICs as eth0 and eth1.
* We recommend that you use the network service instead of NetworkManager.

## Step 5: Check your software

Install Docker on the servers where OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT), OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), and OMS are deployed. The minimum version requirement for Docker is CE 17.03 or later.
