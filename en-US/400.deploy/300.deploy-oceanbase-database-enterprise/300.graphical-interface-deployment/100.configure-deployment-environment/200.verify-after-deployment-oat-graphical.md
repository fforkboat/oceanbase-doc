# Verify OAT deployment

After you deploy OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT), you need to log on to OAT to check whether the deployment is successful.

## Procedure

1. Enter the access address of OAT in the address bar of your browser and press **Enter**.

   OAT access URL: `http://oat_server_ip:7000`.

   Replace `oat_server_ip` with the IP address of the server where OAT is installed.

2. If the logon page appears, OAT is installed and started.

   On the logon page that appears, log on to OAT by using the admin account.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>Contact OceanBase Technical Support to obtain the default password of the admin account. To ensure account security, change the password upon the first logon. </p>
   </main>
