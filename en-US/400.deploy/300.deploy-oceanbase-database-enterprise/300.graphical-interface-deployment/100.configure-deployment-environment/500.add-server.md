# Add a server

Before you deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you must add a server to the system.

## Procedure

1. Log on to OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT).

   OAT access URL: `http://oat_server_ip:7000`.

   On the logon page that appears, use the admin account to log on to OAT.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>Contact OceanBase Technical Support to obtain the default password of the admin account. To ensure account security, change the password upon the first logon. </p>
   </main>

   You must set the following fields in the **Basic Information** and **Initialize Configuration** sections for the server.

   Fields in the **Basic Information** section:

   | Field | Description |
   |-----------|----------------------|
   | Server IP | The public IP address of the server to be added.  |
   | SSH Port | The SSH port number of the server to be added.  |
   | Data Center | The IDC where the server to be added is located.  |
   | Credentials | The access credentials of the server to be added. At present, two types of credentials are supported: (1) username + password (2) key.  |

   Fields in the **Initialize Configuration** section:

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>If you do not configure <strong>Initialize Configuration</strong>, the server may fail to deploy various services associated with OceanBase Database. We recommend that you disable <strong>Initialize Configuration</strong> only in component or product takeover scenarios. </p>
   </main>

   | Field | Description |
   |-----------|----------------------|
   | Initialize Configuration | You do not need to configure **Initialize Configuration** when the server is used for product or component takeover.  |
   | Server Usage | The purpose of the server to be added.  |
   | Docker Root Directory | The data directory of Docker.  |
   | Admin UID:GID | The UID and GID of the `admin` user of the operating system.  |
   | Set Admin Password (Optional) | You can set a password for the `admin` user or use a random password.  |
   | Clock Synchronization | Specifies whether to enable clock synchronization.  |

5. Click **OK**.

   After the server is added, you can view it in the server list.

## More information

After the server is added, you can view it in the server list. The server is in the **Initializing** state. On the **Server Management** page, find the server added and click **View Tasks** in the **Operation** column to view the task progress. At the top of the page, you can search for servers by IP address.

If a failed subtask does not affect services, you can view the logs and then manually set the subtask to successful.
