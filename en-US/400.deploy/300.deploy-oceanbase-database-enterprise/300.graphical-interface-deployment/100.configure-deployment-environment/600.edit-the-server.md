# Edit a server

After you initialize a server, you can change its IDC, SSH access port, and credentials.

## Prerequisites

Before you edit a server, ensure that:

* You have installed OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT) and logged on as either a super administrator or an O&M engineer.
* The server you want to edit has been added, initialized, and is currently in the **Running** state.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OAT console as a super administrator or an O&M engineer.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Server** > **Server Management**.

3. Find the target server, and click **Edit** in the **Operation** column. At the top of the page, you can search for servers by IP address.
