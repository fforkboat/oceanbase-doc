   The following table describes the fields that you need to configure.

   | **Field** | **Description** |
   |------------|----------------------|
   | **IP Address** | The NIC IP address of the OBServer node added to the resource pool.  |
   | **SSH Port** | Default value: `22`.  |
   | **Host Type** | The label that you specify for hosts with the same configurations to facilitate host management. If the required host type is unavailable, you can click **Create Host Type** to add a host type.  |
   | **IDC** | Select the IDC where the server is deployed. IDC information includes **IDC** and **Region**. <ul><li>An IDC is one of the host attributes that you must record for an OceanBase cluster. The IDC is referenced in OceanBase load balancing and SQL statement routing strategies. Specify the actual IDC. </li><li>A region specifies the geographical area where the host is located. It is one of the host attributes that you must record for an OceanBase cluster. The region affects the OceanBase load balancing and SQL statement routing strategies. Specify the actual region. </li></ul><blockquote><b>Note: </b></br>OCP V3.1.1 and later versions support the multi-zone deployment mode. When you add an IDC, the new IDC is created in the zone where the current OCP is located. </blockquote> |
   | **Host Type** | You can select **Physical Machine** or **Container**.  |
   | **Credentials** | Select the credentials used to remotely log on to the physical server. You can select **Add Credential** from the drop-down list to create credentials.  |
