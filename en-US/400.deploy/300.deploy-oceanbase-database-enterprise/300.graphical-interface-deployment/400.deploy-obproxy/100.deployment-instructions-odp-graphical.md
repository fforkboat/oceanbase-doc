# Overview

OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), also known as OBProxy, can forward user-initiated data access requests to the corresponding OBServer node. OCP allows you to create an ODP cluster, view the ODP cluster information, and view the ODP monitoring information.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>This topic takes OCP V4.0.0 as an example. The GUI varies with the OCP version. </li>
    <li>After you deploy ODP on a server, ODP provides the proxy service of OceanBase Database by exposing a socket in the format of IP address:port. You can access OceanBase Database through the socket in the same way you access MySQL databases. We recommend that you deploy ODP on an OBServer node. </li>
    <li>We recommend that you deploy only one ODP on a server and use port <code>2883</code>. If you deploy two or more ODP services on the same server, you must specify different ports. </li>
