# View resources available for a business tenant

After the OceanBase cluster is created, a tenant named `sys` is created in the cluster by default. This tenant is used to manage the OceanBase cluster. We recommend that you do not store business data in the sys tenant. Therefore, you must create a business tenant before you use OceanBase Database. The sys tenant consumes certain CPU and memory resources. You can allocate the remaining CPU and memory resources to the business tenants.

This topic describes how to view resources available for the tenants by using OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. On the **Clusters** tab, click the name of the target cluster.

3. On the **OBServers** tab, you can view the available resources of the servers.

## What to do next

After you confirm the cluster resources, you can create business tenants based on the remaining resources. For more information, see [Create a tenant](2.create-a-tenant-graphical.md).
