# Overview

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) is an enterprise-level database development platform tailored for OceanBase Database. ODC can connect to OceanBase databases in MySQL and Oracle modes. It also provides database developers with features such as database development, WebSQL-based workspace, SQL diagnostics, session management, and data import and export.

## Single-node deployment

In single-node deployment, only one ODC node is deployed. This node handles all user requests. This deployment is simple and consumes fewer resources.

## High-availability deployment

In high-availability deployment, the ODC application is deployed on several server nodes. NGINX is installed on one of the servers as a reverse proxy to handle user requests. Therefore, in single-node deployment, user requests are sent directly to the ODC application, while in high-availability deployment, user requests are first sent to the server where NGINX is deployed, and are then directed to the ODC application on different servers.

One benefit of high-availability deployment is service continuity. If one node is down, NGINX automatically forwards the traffic to other nodes. In addition, high-availability deployment supports more concurrent users and handles more requests than single-node deployment.
