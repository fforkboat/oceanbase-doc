# Verify deployment

After you deploy OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), you can log on to ODC to check if everything is ok.

The GUI varies with the ODC version. This topic takes ODC V2.3.0 as an example. For other ODC versions, see User Guide of the corresponding version.

## Log on to ODC

1. Log on to ODC from its access address.

   The access address is in the format of http://<*IP address of the ODC server*>:8989.

2. On the logon page, enter the default account `admin`.

   > Note
   >
   > Contact OceanBase Technical Support to obtain the default password of the admin account. To ensure account security, change the password upon the first logon.
