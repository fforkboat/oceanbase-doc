# Configure the limits.conf file

This topic describes how to limit the number of processes by configuring the `limits.conf` file. 

If you are an individual user, you can skip this topic. If you are an enterprise user, we recommend that you configure the `limits.conf` file.

You can modify the limit on resources by using the following two methods:

* Modify the limit at the session level when OceanBase Database is started.

* Modify the limit globally by using the `limits.conf` file in the `/etc/security/` directory.

OceanBase Database processes can be limited in terms of the following parameters: Stack, Open Files, and Core File Size. Stack refers to the maximum stack size. Open Files refers to the maximum number of file handles. Core File Size refers to the maximum size of core files.

## Modify parameters

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You must perform this operation on each server. </p>
  </main>

The following example shows how to set the value of the session-level Stack parameter to `unlimited`, the Open Files parameter to `655350`, and the Core File Size parameter to `unlimited`.

Run the following command to open the `limits.conf` file in the `/etc/security/` directory:

```bash
vi /etc/security/limits.conf
```

Add the following content to the `/limits.conf` file in the `/etc/security/` directory:

```bash
root soft nofile 655350
root hard nofile 655350
* soft nofile 655350
* hard nofile 655350
* soft stack 20480
* hard stack 20480
* soft nproc 655360
* hard nproc 655360
* soft core unlimited
* hard core unlimited
```

## View parameters

Log off from the session and log on again. Then, run the following command to view whether the parameters have taken effect:

```bash
ulimit -a
```
