Use OBD to scale out an OceanBase cluster 
==============================================================

This topic shows you how to scale out an OceanBase cluster of the 1-1-1 architecture to an OceanBase cluster of the 2-2-2 architecture by using OceanBase Deployer (OBD). 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

In this example, six servers are used. Three of them are used to create a cluster, and their IP addresses are 172.30.199.30, 172.30.199.31, and 172.30.199.32. The other three are to be added to the cluster, and their IP addresses are 172.30.199.33, 172.30.199.34, and 172.30.199.35. 
**Notice**



You have created a cluster of the 1-1-1 architecture, with three servers evenly distributed in three zones. For more information about cluster configuration, see [amber.yaml](https://github.com/Xjxjy/scale-out-oceanbase-cluster/blob/main/amber.yaml).

View cluster information 
---------------------------------------------

1. Run the following command to connect to OceanBase Database:

   ```unknow
   obclient -h 127.0.1 -uroot@sys -P2888 -A -c
   ```

   

2. Run the following command to create a user tenant named amber_babe:

   ```unknow
   obd cluster tenant create -n amber_babe
   ALTER TENANT amber_babe SET VARIABLES ob_tcp_invited_nodes='%';
   ```

   
   **Note**

   

   The tenant name `amber_babe` in the example is for your reference only. You can name the tenant as needed.
   

3. Run the following command to check whether the tenant is created:

   ```unknow
   SELECT * FROM oceanbase.gv$tenant;
   ```

   

4. Run the following command to view the servers:

   ```unknow
   select svr_ip,id,zone,status from __all_server;
   ```

   

   You can see three servers in the result returned by the command.
   




Scale out the cluster 
------------------------------------------

1. Write a new configuration file and run the following command to deploy it by using OBD.

   ```unknow
   obd cluster deploy amber2 -c amber2.yaml
   ```

   
   **Note**

   

   `amber2` in the preceding command and `amber` in the command of Step 3 are the names of the configuration files. You can name the files as needed. For more information about the new configuration file, see [amber2.yaml](https://github.com/Xjxjy/scale-out-oceanbase-cluster/blob/main/amber2.yaml).
   

2. Copy the new configuration to the existing configuration file.

   1. Run the following command to view the directory of the configuration file.

      ```unknow
      obd cluster list
      ```

      
   
   2. Run the following command to open the existing configuration file and copy the content of the new configuration file to the existing configuration file.

      ```unknow
      vim .obd/cluster/amber/config.yaml
      ```

      

      You need to paste the copied content after the existing content. For more information, see [Configuration file](https://github.com/Xjxjy/scale-out-oceanbase-cluster/blob/main/amber3.yaml).
      
   

   

3. Run the following command to restart the cluster.

   ```unknow
   obd cluster start amber
   ```

   

4. Run the following command to reconnect to OceanBase Database and add new observer processes.

   ```unknow
   ALTER SYSTEM ADD SERVER 'server_ip:port_num' ZONE 'zone1';
   ALTER SYSTEM ADD SERVER 'server_ip:port_num' ZONE 'zone2';
   ALTER SYSTEM ADD SERVER 'server_ip:port_num' ZONE 'zone3';
   ```

   

5. Run the following command to view the scale-out result.

   ```unknow
   select svr_ip,id,zone,status from __all_server;
   ```

   

   If you can see that each zone has two processes in the returned result, the scale-out is successful.
   

6. Run the following command to scale out the amber_babe tenant.

   ```unknow
   # Run the following command to add units
   MySQL [oceanbase]> alter resource pool amber_babe_pool unit_num=2;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.146 sec)
   ```
