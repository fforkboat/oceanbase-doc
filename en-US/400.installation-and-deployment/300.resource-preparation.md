We are testing the adaptability of more software and hardware options. 
**Note**



If you plan to deploy an OceanBase cluster, make sure that all servers in the cluster have the same configurations.

For the CentOS or Red Hat, run the following command to manually disable the transparent huge page mode:

```unknow
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled
```
