# Overview

You can deploy OceanBase Community Edition in the following ways:

* Quick deployment: If you want to quickly deploy a standalone edition to experience its features, deploy OceanBase Community Edition by referring to the quick deployment solution.
* Standard deployment: If you want to perform standard deployment in a production environment, deploy OceanBase Community Edition by referring to the standard deployment solution.
* Deployment for online experience: If you want to experience the database online, deploy OceanBase Community Edition by referring to the online experience deployment solution.

## Quick deployment

For non-natively supported operating systems such as Mac OS and Windows, we recommend that you deploy the database by using the Docker image. For more information, see [Quickly experience OceanBase Database](../2.quick-start/0.Quickly-experience-OceanBase.md).
For natively supported operating systems such as Linux, we recommend that you deploy the database by using OceanBase Deployer (OBD) in a one-click manner. For more information, see [Use OBD to deploy OceanBase Database](../2.quick-start/0.Quickly-experience-OceanBase.md).

## Standard deployment

In an offline environment, we recommend that you use OBD for standard deployment. For more information, see [Deploy OceanBase Database offline](../5.installation-and-deployment/2.local-deployment/5.deploy-oceanbase-database-in-the-production-environment.md).
In a Kubernetes environment, we recommend that you use ob-operator for deployment. For more information, see [Deploy OceanBase Database in a Kubernetes cluster](../5.installation-and-deployment/3.deploy-in-the-k8s-cluster.md).

## Deployment for online experience

If you only want to experience the features online, you can use the OceanBase Community Edition experience site.
