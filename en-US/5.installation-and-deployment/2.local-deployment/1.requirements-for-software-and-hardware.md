# Software and hardware requirements

OceanBase Database is a distributed cluster product that requires at least three servers in the production environment. In a learning environment, you can deploy the standalone edition. OceanBase Database has much in common with conventional databases in deployment. Suggestions for the hardware and software settings of the operating system will be provided based on best practices. These are the basis for OceanBase Database to achieve high performance and run stably.

## Software resources

The following table provides links for downloading the installation packages of OceanBase Database that are suitable for different operating systems:

| Operating systems | RPM download link |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Anlios 7, CentOS 7, RedHat 7, Ubuntu 20.X, Debian 9.X, and Anolis OS 8.X | [Download RPM packages for el7](https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/community/stable/el/7/x86_64/) |
| Anlios 8, CentOS 8, RedHat 8,Debian 10, and Anolis OS 8.X | [Download RPM packages for el8](https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/community/stable/el/8/x86_64/) |

> **Notice**
>
> We recommend that you download installation packages of the latest version.

## Hardware resources

OceanBase Database V4.0 has been systematically tested and verified. We recommend that you deploy it in an environment that meets the following software and hardware requirements:

| Item | Description |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operating system | <ul> <li> Anolis OS 8.X (Linux kernel V3.10.0 or later) -- Recommended</li><li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.X and 8.X (Linux kernel V3.10.0 or later) -- Recommended</li><li>CentOS Linux 7.X and 8.X (Linux kernel V3.10.0 or later) -- Recommended</li><li>Debian 9.X or later (Linux kernel 3.10.0 or later)</li><li>Ubuntu 20.X or later (Linux kernel 3.10.0 or later) </li><li>SUSE/OpenSUSE 15.X or later (Linux kernel 3.10.0 or later) -- Recommended </ul> |
| CPU | <ul><li> For enterprise users, at least 16 cores are required and 32 cores or more are recommended. </li> <li>For individual users, at least 2 cores are required and 8 cores or more are recommended.</li><li>For a performance test, 24 cores or more are recommended.<li>For the production environment, 32 cores or more are recommended.</ul> |
| Memory | <ul><li> For enterprise users, at least 64 GB is required and 256 GB or more is recommended. </li><li> For individual users, at least 8 GB is required for trial use, at least 32 GB is required for long-term use, and 64 GB or more is recommended for long-term use.  </li><li>If the memory is less than 64 GB, we recommend that you use OBD to deploy the cluster and do not use OCP to deploy a small-scale cluster.</li><li>For a performance test, 128 GB or more is recommended.<li>For the production environment, 256 GB or more is recommended.<ul> |
| Disk type | SSD (recommended) |
| Disk space | Four times the memory size or more |
| File system | EXT4 or XFS. Choose XFS when the data volume exceeds 16 TB. |
| NIC | Gigabit Ethernet and above |

We are testing the adaptability of more software and hardware options.

> **Note**
>
> If you plan to deploy an OceanBase cluster, make sure that all servers in the cluster have the same configurations. Here the resource requirements on the performance test environment and production environment are for reference only. In later versions of OceanBase Community Edition, the requirement on the memory will be lowered.

For the CentOS or Red Hat operating system, run the following command to manually disable the transparent huge page mode:

```bash
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled
```
