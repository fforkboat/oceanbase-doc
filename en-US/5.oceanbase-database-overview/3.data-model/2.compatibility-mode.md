Compatibility mode 
=======================================



OceanBase Database enables you to create tenants in MySQL mode. After you create a MySQL tenant, you cannot change its compatibility mode. All its data types, SQL features, and views are compatible with MySQL databases. 

This tenant type is designed to reduce system restructuring costs of migrating a MySQL database to an OceanBase database. It enables database designers, developers, and administrators to quickly start with OceanBase Database by reusing their knowledge and experience gained from using MySQL databases. At present, OceanBase Database supports the entire MySQL 5.6 syntax and the seamless switching of services between MySQL databases and OceanBase databases in MySQL mode.
