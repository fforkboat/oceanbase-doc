Overview
========

The storage engine layer handles data storage and queries and enables primary key insertion, update, deletion, data locking, random access, and range lookup operations at the SQL layer. The SQL layer may in turn push some filtering conditions, expression calculation, and limit operations to the storage layer. The database function layer is built on the storage engine layer.
