Archive log round
=================

OceanBase Database regularly backs up system archive logs and is not subject to the control of the backup set. Each time you run the ALTER SYSTEM ARCHIVELOG command to start log archiving, the number of archive log rounds increases by 1. An archive log round is a complete and continuous log backup.

Log archiving has no independent backup management command. Each time you delete the Backup Set of a data backup, OceanBase automatically deletes log archiving files that are no longer needed. If an archive log round is older than all existing backup sets, OceanBase will delete the entire archive log round.
