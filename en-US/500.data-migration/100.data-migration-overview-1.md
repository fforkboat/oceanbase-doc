Data migration is a common O\&M operation essential for cluster load balancing and IDC migration. You can use commands to perform operations such as data archiving for a cluster or for tables, disk-level load balancing, and resource unit migration in OceanBase Database. However, to perform operations such as data synchronization between heterogeneous data sources and between clusters, you need to use external tools. 

This topic describes the following data migration methods and tools:

* [Migrate data by using SQL scripts](./4.migrate-data-by-using-sql-scripts-1.md)

  

* [Migrate data by using MySQLDump](./5.use-mysqldump-to-migrate-data-1.md)

  

* [Migrate data by using DataX](./6.use-datax-to-migrate-data-1.md)

  

* [Migrate data by using OUTFILE statements](./7.use-outfile-statements-to-migrate-data-1.md)
