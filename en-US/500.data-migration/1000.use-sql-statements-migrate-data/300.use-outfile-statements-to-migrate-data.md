# Export data by using OUTFILE statements

This topic describes how to use a `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` statement to export data. The `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` statement allows you to specify the fields to be exported, and is preferred when primary key fields do not need to be exported. You can use this statement in combination with the `LOAD DATA INFILE` statement to facilitate data import and export.

## Background

OceanBase Database is compatible with the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` statement.

| Mode | Recommended OceanBase Database version | Recommended client |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| MySQL mode | V2.2.40 and later | MySQL client and OBClient |
| Oracle mode | V2.2.40 and later | OBClient |

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>To import data into and export data from OceanBase Database, the client must be connected to the OceanBase Database instance directly. </p>
  </main>

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_list_option
INTO OUTFILE file_route_option
    [format_of_field_option]
    [start_and_end_option]
FROM table_name_list
[WHERE where_conditions]
[GROUP BY group_by_list [HAVING having_search_conditions]]
[ORDER BY order_expression_list]

column_list_option:
    column_name[,column_name]...

file_route_option:
    '/path/file'
    | 'oss://$PATH/$FILENAME/?host=$HOST&access_id=$ACCESS_ID&access_key=$ACCESSKEY'

format_of_field_option:
    {FIELDS | COLUMNS}
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
        [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char']
        [ESCAPED BY 'char']

start_and_end_option:
    LINES
        [STARTING BY 'string']
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
```

| Parameter | Required | Description | Example |
|------------------------|---------|----------|---------------------|
| column_list_option | Yes | Column options for the export. To select all data, use an asterisk (`*`). </br>`column_name`: The name of the column to be exported.  | `SELECT col1,col2,col3 ...` |
| file_route_option | Yes | The path of the exported file. Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) is supported. <blockquote>**Note** </br>OSS has a restriction on the file size. If a file exported to OSS exceeds 5 GB, the file is split into multiple files, each smaller than 5 GB. </blockquote> | `... INTO OUTFILE '/home/admin/student.sql' ...` |
| format_of_field_option | No | Field format options for the export. You can use the `FIELDS` or `COLUMNS` clause to specify the format of each field in the output file. <ul><li>`TERMINATED BY`: specifies the separator between field values. For example, `TERMINATED BY ','` specifies that field values are separated with commas (,). </li><li>`ENCLOSED BY`: specifies the symbol for enclosing field values. For example, `ENCLOSED BY '"'` specifies that character values are enclosed within a pair of double quotation marks (""). If the `OPTIONALLY` keyword is used, only values of the string type are enclosed within the specified symbols. </li><li>`ESCAPED BY`: specifies the escape character. For example, `ESCAPED BY '*'` indicates that the asterisk (*) but not the backslash (\\) is used as the escape character. The backslash (\\) is the default escape character. </li></ul> | `... TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' ...` |
| start_and_end_option | No | Start and end character options for exported data rows. `LINES`: specifies the characters to enclose each line in the output file. <ul><li>`STARTING BY`: specifies the character to start each line. </li><li>`TERMINATED BY`: specifies the character to end each line. </li></ul> | `... LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' ...` specifies that a row ends with a line feed.  |
| FROM table_name_list | Yes | The object from which data is selected.  | `... FROM tbl1,tbl2 ...` |
| WHERE where_conditions | No | The filter condition. Only data that meets the condition is returned in the query results.  | `... WHERE col1 > 100 ...` |
| GROUP BY group_by_list | No | The grouping field, which is usually used together with aggregate functions. <blockquote><b>Note</b></br>If no column following the `SELECT` clause uses any aggregate function, the columns following the SELECT clause must be specified after the `GROUP BY` clause. </blockquote> | `... GROUP BY col1,col2 ...` |
| HAVING having_search_conditions | No | Filters the grouped data. The `HAVING` clause is similar to the `WHERE` clause, but the `HAVING` clause can reference an aggregate function such as `SUM` and `AVG`.  | `... HAVING SUM(col1) < 160 ...` |
| ORDER BY order_expression_list | No | Sorts the query results by one or multiple columns in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. If you do not specify `ASC` or `DESC`, the default value `ASC` is used. <ul><li>`ASC`: indicates an ascending order. </li><li>`DESC`: indicates a descending order. </li></ul> | `... ORDER BY col1,col2 DESC ...` |

## Examples

The following takes exporting data to a local device as an example to describe how to export data.

1. Create a table named `tbl1` in the `test` database in the `mysql001` tenant and insert data into the table.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> CREATE TABLE tbl1(col1 INT PRIMARY KEY,col2 varchar(128),col3 INT);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient [test]> INSERT INTO tbl1 VALUES(1,'one',80),(2,'two',90),(3,'three',100);
   Query OK, 3 rows affected
   Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

   obclient [test]> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
   +------+-------+------+
   | col1 | col2  | col3 |
   +------+-------+------+
   |    1 | one   |   80 |
   |    2 | two   |   90 |
   |    3 | three |  100 |
   +------+-------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

2. Set a path for the exported file.

   Log on to the tenant as an administrator (`root` for a MySQL tenant and `SYS` for an Oracle tenant), and set the system variable `secure_file_priv` to specify the path to be accessed during file import or export.

   The global system variable `secure_file_priv` specifies the path accessible when you import/export data to/from a file. The default value is `NULL`, indicating that file import and export are disabled. For more information, see [secure_file_priv (MySQL mode)](../../7.reference/5.system-reference/2.system-variable-of-mysql-mode/115.secure_file_priv-of-mysql-mode.md) and [secure_file_priv (Oracle mode)](../../7.reference/5.system-reference/3.system-variable-of-oracle-mode/114.secure_file_priv-of-oracle-mode.md).

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>For security reasons, when you set the system variable <code>secure_file_priv</code>, you can use only the local client to execute the SQL statement that modifies the global variable. Specifically, the OBClient is installed on the OBServer to connect to. </p>
    </main>

    1. Log on to the OBServer to connect to.
    
        ```bash
        [xxx@xxx /home/admin]# ssh admin@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
        ```
    
    2. Use the OBClient to connect to the `mysql001` tenant in direct connection mode.
    
        ```bash
        [admin@xxx /home/admin]# obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -uroot@mysql001 -p -A
        Enter password:

        obclient [(none)]>
        ```
    
    3. Set the export path to `/home/admin`.
    
        ```sql
        obclient [(none)]> SET GLOBAL secure_file_priv = "/home/admin";
        Query OK, 0 rows affected
        ```

3. Use the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` statement to export data from the `tbl1` table. The name of the exported file is `tbl1.sql`. The field values are separated with a comma (,). The values of the string type are enclosed within a pair of double quotations marks (`"`). The end symbol is a line feed.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> SELECT * INTO OUTFILE '/home/admin/tbl1.sql'
       FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
       LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
       FROM tbl1;
   Query OK, 3 rows affected
   ```

4. Log on to the OBServer and check the information about the exported file in the `/home/admin` directory on your local device.

   ```bash
   [xxx@xxx /home/admin]# cat tbl1.sql
   1,"one",80
   2,"two",90
   3,"three",100
   ```

## More information

You can use the `LOAD DATA` statement to import the files that are exported by using `SELECT INTO OUTFILE`. For more information, see [Import data by using the LOAD DATA statement](../7.migrate-data-from-csv-file-to-oceanbase-database/2.use-the-load-command-to-load-the-csv-data-file-to-the-oceanbase-database.md).
