# Overview

OceanBase Database allows you to insert data into a database by using bypass import. In other words, OceanBase Database can directly write data into data files. With the bypass import feature, you can bypass interfaces in the SQL layer and directly allocate space and insert data into data files, thereby improving the data import efficiency.

## Scenarios

The bypass import feature applies to the following scenarios:

* Data migration and synchronization: In data migration or synchronization, a large amount of data of different types must be migrated from different data sources to OceanBase Database. Conventional SQL interfaces cannot meet the requirement on timeliness. 

* Conventional extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL): After data is extracted and transformed in the source, a large amount of data must be loaded to the destination within a short time. The bypass import technology can improve the import performance. For the ETL technology, the data loading efficiency can also be improved by using bypass import. 

* Data loading from text files or other data sources to OceanBase database: The data loading efficiency can be improved by using bypass import. 

## Supported statements for bypass import

At present, OceanBase Database supports the following statements for bypass import:

* `LOAD /*+ APPEND */ DATA`

* `INSERT /*+ APPEND */ INTO SELECT`

## Considerations

Bypass import will write all existing data. If the source table contains a large amount of data but only a small amount of data needs to be imported, bypass import is inappropriate in this case.
