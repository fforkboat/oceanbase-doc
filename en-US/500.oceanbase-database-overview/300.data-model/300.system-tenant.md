System tenant
=============

The system tenant is a built-in tenant of OceanBase Database.

It is a container for the system data of OceanBase Database. All system data and system tables are stored under its namespace.

The system tenant also performs cluster administration tasks for OceanBase Database. These include adding and removing user tenants, modifying cluster-level configuration, scheduling rotating major compactions, disaster recovery, as well as resource and load balancing. The system tenant allocates the resource needed for system operation, maintenance, and management tasks. For example, it provides resources for operations that do not involve resource splitting at the tenant level, such as leader election and rotating major compaction for log synchronization.
