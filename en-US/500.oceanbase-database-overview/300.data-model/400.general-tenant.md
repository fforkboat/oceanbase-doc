General tenant
==============

A general tenant corresponds to a common database management system and is equivalent to a database instance.

The system tenant creates general tenants on demand and specifies the name and resources of a general tenant upon its creation. The amount of resources available to a general tenant may be dynamically adjusted. Similar to a common database system, a general tenant has all the features of a database instance. A general tenant may create its users and objects such as databases and tables. It also has its system databases such as information_schema, as well as a separate set of system variables.

Key system tables 
--------------------------

**__all_table/__all_column**

Each general tenant has one __all_table and one __all_column table. They record the schemas of user tables in this tenant.

**__all_tenant_meta_table**

Each general tenant has one __all_tenant_meta_table, which records the physical location metadata of the tenant's user tables.
