MATERIAL 
=============================

The `MATERIAL` operator materializes the data output of subsequent operators. 

OceanBase Database executes a plan by streaming data. Sometimes, however, an operator cannot execute a plan until subsequent operators have all data output. Therefore, a `MATERIAL` operator is added to materialize all the data. The `MATERIAL` operator can also avoid the repeated execution of a subplan when the subplan needs to be executed repeatedly. 

In the following example, when a `NESTED LOOP JOIN` operation is performed on tables `t1` and `t2`, repeated scans are required for the table on the right side. So, a `MATERIAL` operator could be added to the table on the right side to save all data of table `t2`. 

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>CREATE TABLE t2(c1 INT ,c2 INT ,c3 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT  /*+ORDERED USE_NL(T2)*/* FROM t1,t2 
         WHERE t1.c1=t2.c1\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:

|ID|OPERATOR        |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST  |

|0 |NESTED-LOOP JOIN|    |2970     |277377|
|1 | TABLE SCAN     |t1  |3        |37    |
|2 | MATERIAL       |    |100000   |176342|
|3 |  TABLE SCAN    |t2  |100000   |70683 |
===========================================
Outputs & filters: 
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [t1.c3], [t2.c1], [t2.c2], [t2.c3]), filter(nil), 
      conds([t1.c1 = t2.c1]), nl_params_(nil)
  1 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [t1.c3]), filter(nil), 
      access([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [t1.c3]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([t2.c1], [t2.c2], [t2.c3]), filter(nil)
  3 - output([t2.c1], [t2.c2], [t2.c3]), filter(nil), 
      access([t2.c1], [t2.c2], [t2.c3]), partitions(p0)
```



In the preceding example, the function of `MATERIAL`, the No. 2 operator in the execution plan display, is to save data of table `t2` to avoid scanning table `t2` from the disk for every `JOIN` operation. The `Outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display shows in detail the output information of the `MATERIAL` operator.

| output    | The output expression of the operator.  `rownum()` indicates the expression corresponding to `ROWNUM`.                                              |
| filter    | The filter conditions of the operator.  In this example, the condition is set to `nil` because no filter is configured for the `MATERIAL` operator. |
