EXCEPT/MINUS 
=================================

The `EXCEPT` operator performs a difference-set operation on the output of the left and right suboperators, and deduplicate the result. 

Generally, the `MINUS` operator is used in Oracle mode to perform difference set operations, whereas the `EXCEPT` operator is used in MySQL mode to perform difference set operations. In OceanBase Database, however, both `EXCEPT` and `MINUS` operators can be used for difference-set operations in MySQL mode. 

`EXCEPT` operators supported by OceanBase Database include `MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT` and `HASH EXCEPT DISTINCT`. 

MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT 
------------------------------------------

In the following example, Q1 uses the `MINUS` operator to connect the two queries. Because a sorting method is available for c1, the `MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator is used as the No. 0 operator to obtain the difference set and deduplicate the result. Because no sorting method is available for `c2`, a `SORT` operator is assigned before the No. 3 operator for sorting. When these operators are executed, they read ordered inputs from the left and right subnodes, and merge and deduplicate the rows to generate the difference set. 

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1,1);
Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2,2);
Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.12 sec)

Q1: 
obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT c1 FROM t1 MINUS SELECT c2 FROM t1\G;

|0 |MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT|    |2        |77  |

|3 |  TABLE SCAN         |T1  |2        |37  |

Outputs & filters: 
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([MINUS(T1.C1, T1.C2)]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C1]), filter(nil), 
      access([T1.C1]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C2, ASC])
  3 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil), 
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```



In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section in the demo shows in detail the output information of the `MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator.

|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| output    | The output expression of the operator.  The respective output of the two suboperators connected by using `EXCEPT` or `MINUS`. `MINUS` is used in Oracle mode, and `EXCEPT` in MySQL mode. It indicates a column in the output of the difference set operation. Within the brackets are the output columns of the left and right subnodes corresponding to this column. |
| filter    | The filter conditions of the operator.  In this example, the condition is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator.                                                                                                                                                                                             |



HASH EXCEPT DISTINCT 
-----------------------------------------

In the following example, Q2 uses the `MINUS` operator to connect the two queries. Because no sorting method is available, the `HASH EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator is used as the No. 0 operator to generate the difference set and deduplicate the result. When the operator is being executed, it first reads the output of the left subnode to create a hash table and removes duplicate rows. Then, it reads the output of the right subnode, and uses the hash table to generate the difference set and deduplicate the result. 

```javascript
Q2: 
obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT c2 FROM t1 MINUS SELECT c2 FROM t1\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
=============================================
|ID|OPERATOR            |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
---------------------------------------------
|0 |HASH EXCEPT DISTINCT|    |2        |77  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN         |T1  |2        |37  |
|2 | TABLE SCAN         |T1  |2        |37  |
=============================================
Outputs & filters: 
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([MINUS(T1.C2, T1.C2)]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil), 
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil), 
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```



In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section in the demo shows in detail the output information of the `HASH EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator. Fields of the operator have the same meaning as those of the `MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator.
