WINDOW FUNCTION 
====================================

The `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator implements SQL analytic functions, or window functions, to calculate the results of relevant rows in a window. 

Window functions differ from aggregate functions in that, the latter returns only one row from a group of data, while window functions return multiple rows from a group. Each row in the group is the result of a window-based logical calculation. Therefore, in the execution of an SQL statement that includes a `WINDOW FUNCTION`, whose format is generally `OVER(...)`, a `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator is assigned while generating the execution plan. 

Example: An execution plan that includes a `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2, 2);
Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.12 sec)

obclient>INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(3, 3);
Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.12 sec)

Q1: 
obclient>EXPLAIN SELECT MAX(c1) OVER(PARTITION BY c1 ORDER BY c2) FROM t1\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
| ========================================
|ID|OPERATOR       |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
----------------------------------------
|0 |WINDOW FUNCTION|    |3        |45  |
|1 | SORT          |    |3        |44  |
|2 |  TABLE SCAN   |T1  |3        |37  |
========================================

Outputs & filters: 
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T_FUN_MAX(T1.C1)]), filter(nil), 
      win_expr(T_FUN_MAX(T1.C1)), partition_by([T1.C1]), order_by([T1.C2, ASC]), window_type(RANGE), upper(UNBOUNDED PRECEDING), lower(CURRENT ROW)
  1 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C1, ASC], [T1.C2, ASC])
  2 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil), 
      access([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```



When an `ORDER BY` or `PARTITION BY` is specified in a window function, a `SORT` operator is assigned at the subsequent layer to return the sorting result to the `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator. 

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display of query Q1 shows in detail the output information of the `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator.

|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| output       | The output expression of the operator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| filter       | The filter conditions of the operator.  In this example, the condition is set to `nil` because no filter is configured for the `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| win_expr     | Indicates the aggregate function to be used in the window.  For example, query Q1 obtains the maximum value of column `c1`, so the function is `T_FUN_MAX(t1.c1)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| partition_by | Indicates how groups are partitioned in the window.  For example, query Q1 is partitioned by column `c1`, so the value is `t1.c1`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| order_by     | Indicates how rows are ordered in the window.  For example, query Q1 requires ordering by column `c2`, so the value is `t1.c2`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| window_type  | The type of the window, which could be either "range" or "rows": * range: In the default "range" mode, the upper and lower boundaries of the window are calculated based on logical offsets.   * rows: In the "rows" mode, the upper and lower boundaries of the window are calculated based on physical offsets.    For example, the default "range" mode is selected in query Q1 as no window type is specified.                                                                                                 |
| upper        | Sets the upper boundary of the window: * `UNBOUNDED`: No boundary is specified and the maximum value is used (default).   * `CURRENT ROW`: Starts from the current row. A numeric value indicates the number of rows to move from the current.   * `PRECEDING`: sets the boundary in the preceding rows.   * `FOLLOWING`: sets the boundary in the following rows.    For example, the upper boundary in query Q1 is set to unbounded preceding. |
| lower        | Sets the lower boundary of the window. The attribute settings are the same as those of the upper boundary.  For example, the lower boundary in query Q1 is set to the current row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
