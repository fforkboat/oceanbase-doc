Backup set
==========

OceanBase Database uses Backup Set to manage data backups. Each data backup has a backup_set_id, which is globally unique in the cluster.

For full backups, OceanBase creates an independent metadata directory and a macroblock directory. For incremental backups, it creates an independent metadata directory and reuses the macroblock directory of the corresponding full backups.

The incremental backup of OceanBase Database contains complete metadata and reused data of macroblocks without affecting the restoration performance.

OceanBase takes the full backup and the corresponding incremental backups as one management unit. You cannot separately delete a single incremental or full backup in a group of backups.
