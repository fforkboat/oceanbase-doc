Delete an index 
====================================

Maintenance costs increase with the number of indexes. We recommend that you delete unnecessary indexes. 

In MySQL mode, you can use either of the following statements to delete an index:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP key|index index_name ;
```



or

```sql
DROP INDEX index_name ON table_name;
```



Example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t3 DROP KEY t3_uk, DROP KEY t3_ind3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)
```
