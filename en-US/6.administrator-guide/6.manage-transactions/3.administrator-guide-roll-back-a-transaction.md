Roll back a transaction 
============================================

A transaction rollback reverses all changes made in the transaction. You can roll back an entire uncommitted transaction or roll back a transaction to any of its savepoints. To roll back to a specific savepoint, you must use both the `ROLLBACK` and `TO SAVEPOINT` statements. 

If you roll back an entire transaction:

* The transaction ends.

  

* All changes made from the start of the transaction are discarded.

  

* All savepoints are cleared.

  

* All locks held by the transaction are released.

  




If you roll back a transaction to a specific savepoint:

* The transaction does not end.

  

* Changes made before the savepoint are retained but those made after it are discarded.

  

* All savepoints after the specific savepoint are cleared.

  

* All locks held by the transaction after the specific savepoint are released.

  




Roll back an entire transaction 
----------------------------------------------------

Example:

* Roll back an entire transaction in MySQL mode: 

  ```sql
  obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
  +----+------+-------+---------------------+
  | ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE          |
  +----+------+-------+---------------------+
  |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2020-04-02 17:52:31 |
  |  2 | US   | 10002 | 2020-04-02 17:52:38 |
  |  3 | EN   | 10003 | 2020-04-02 17:52:38 |
  +----+------+-------+---------------------+
  3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  
  obclient> BEGIN;
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  
  obclient> INSERT INTO t_insert(id, name, value) VALUES(4,'JP',10004);
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
  
  obclient> INSERT INTO t_insert(id, name, value) VALUES(5,'FR',10005),(6,'RU',10006);
  Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
  
  obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
  +----+------+-------+---------------------+
  | ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE          |
  +----+------+-------+---------------------+
  |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2020-04-02 17:52:31 |
  |  2 | US   | 10002 | 2020-04-02 17:52:38 |
  |  3 | EN   | 10003 | 2020-04-02 17:52:38 |
  |  4 | JP   |  NULL | 2020-04-02 17:53:34 |
  |  5 | FR   | 10005 | 2020-04-02 17:54:53 |
  |  6 | RU   | 10006 | 2020-04-02 17:54:53 |
  +----+------+-------+---------------------+
  6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  
  obclient> ROLLBACK;
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  
  obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
  +----+------+-------+---------------------+
  | ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE          |
  +----+------+-------+---------------------+
  |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2020-04-02 17:52:31 |
  |  2 | US   | 10002 | 2020-04-02 17:52:38 |
  |  3 | EN   | 10003 | 2020-04-02 17:52:38 |
  +----+------+-------+---------------------+
  3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  




Roll back a transaction to a savepoint 
-----------------------------------------------------------

The transaction in the following example contains several data manipulation language (DML) statements and several savepoints. After the transaction is rolled back to a specific savepoint, only the modifications after the savepoint are discarded. 

* MySQL mode

  1. View the records in the table: 

     ```sql
     obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     | id | name | value | gmt_create          |
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2020-04-03 16:05:45 |
     |  2 | US   | 10002 | 2020-04-03 16:05:54 |
     |  3 | UK   | 10003 | 2020-04-03 16:05:54 |
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
     ```

     
  
  2. Start a transaction and set several savepoints: 

     ```sql
     obclient> SET SESSION autocommit=off;
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
     
     obclient> BEGIN;
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
     
     obclient> INSERT INTO t_insert(id, name) VALUES(6,'FR');
     Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
     
     obclient> SAVEPOINT fr;
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
     
     obclient> INSERT INTO t_insert(id, name) VALUES(7,'RU');
     Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
     
     obclient> SAVEPOINT ru;
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
     
     obclient> INSERT INTO t_insert(id, name) VALUES(8,'CA');
     Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
     
     obclient> SAVEPOINT ca;
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
     ```

     
  
  3. View all the uncommitted modifications in the current transaction of the current session: 

     ```sql
     obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     | id | name | value | gmt_create          |
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2020-04-03 16:05:45 |
     |  2 | US   | 10002 | 2020-04-03 16:05:54 |
     |  3 | UK   | 10003 | 2020-04-03 16:05:54 |
     |  6 | FR   |  NULL | 2020-04-03 16:26:22 |
     |  7 | RU   |  NULL | 2020-04-03 16:26:32 |
     |  8 | CA   |  NULL | 2020-04-03 16:26:42 |
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
     ```

     
  
  4. Roll back the transaction to one of its savepoints: 

     ```sql
     obclient> ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT ru;
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
     
     obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     | id | name | value | gmt_create          |
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2020-04-03 16:05:45 |
     |  2 | US   | 10002 | 2020-04-03 16:05:54 |
     |  3 | UK   | 10003 | 2020-04-03 16:05:54 |
     |  6 | FR   |  NULL | 2020-04-03 16:26:22 |
     |  7 | RU   |  NULL | 2020-04-03 16:26:32 |
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
     ```

     
  
  5. Commit the transaction and make sure the latest changes include those made before the savepoint: 

     ```sql
     obclient> COMMIT;
     Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
     
     obclient> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     | id | name | value | gmt_create          |
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2020-04-03 16:05:45 |
     |  2 | US   | 10002 | 2020-04-03 16:05:54 |
     |  3 | UK   | 10003 | 2020-04-03 16:05:54 |
     |  6 | FR   |  NULL | 2020-04-03 16:26:22 |
     |  7 | RU   |  NULL | 2020-04-03 16:26:32 |
     +----+------+-------+---------------------+
     5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
     ```
