Create a user 
==================================

This topic describes how to create an OceanBase database user. 

Create users in MySQL mode by using SQL statements 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* MySQL mode

  The user management syntax tree in MySQL mode is as follows:

  ```sql
  create_user_stmt:
      CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS] user_name [IDENTIFIED BY 'password'];
  
  alter_user_stmt:
        ALTER USER user_name ACCOUNT {LOCK | UNLOCK};
      | ALTER USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
      | SET PASSWORD [FOR user_name] = PASSWORD('password');
      | RENAME USER rename_user_action_list;
  
  drop_user_stmt:
      DROP USER user_name_list;
  
  rename_user_action_list:
      rename_user_action [, rename_user_action ...]
  
  rename_user_action:
      user_name TO user_name
  
  user_name_list:
      user_name [, user_name ...]
  
  password:
      STR_VALUE
  ```

  

  The following example statement creates users `sqluser01` and `sqluser02` whose passwords are `123456` in MySQL mode:

  ```sql
  obclient> CREATE USER 'sqluser01' IDENTIFIED BY '123456', 'sqluser02' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
  ```
