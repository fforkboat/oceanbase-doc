OBClient 
=============================

The OceanBase client (OBClient) is compatible with MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database. It is the recommended command-line client. Click its [GitHub](https://github.com/oceanbase/obclient) link to obtain the client. 

You can use the OBClient to connect to the OceanBase Database by running the following command:

```sql
obclient -u[Username]@[Tenant name]#[Cluster name] -P[Port No.] -h[IP address] -p[Password] -D[Database name] -c
```


**Note**



* If the command does not have the `-c` option, the hint does not take effect after you connect to the tenant.

  

* By default, if the statement does not have the `-D[Database name]` option, the username is used as the database name.
