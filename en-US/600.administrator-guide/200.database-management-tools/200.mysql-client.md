MySQL client 
=================================



We recommend that you install the official Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver mysql-connector-Java V5.1.30 or V5.1.40 provided by MySQL. Compatibility issues may occur if you use other versions. 

OceanBase Database supports the syntax of MySQL 5.6.25 only. If you use the MySQL 8.0 client, a syntax compatibility issue may occur. Therefore, we recommend that you use the OBClient or MySQL 5.6 client. 

The following is an example statement for connecting to a MySQL tenant of the OceanBase database from a MySQL client:

```javascript
mysql -u[Username]@[Tenant name]#[Cluster name] -P[Port No.] -h[IP address] -p[Password] -D[Database name] -c
```


**Note**



If the connection statement does not contain the `-c` option, the hint does not take effect after you connect to the MySQL tenant.
