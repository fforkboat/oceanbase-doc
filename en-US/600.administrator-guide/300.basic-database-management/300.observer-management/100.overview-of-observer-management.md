Overview of OBServer management 
====================================================

An OceanBase Server (OBServer) is an OceanBase database node, which is not a physical server. observer is the name of the distributed database kernel process running on a node. 

Each observer process of an OceanBase database is uniquely identified by an IP address and a port number. Typically, a physical or virtual server runs one observer process. As the core process for the OceanBase database, the observer process provides almost all database kernel features, including the SQL engine, storage engine, and transaction engine. The process also provides distributed features such as RPC communication, load balancing, and partition management.
