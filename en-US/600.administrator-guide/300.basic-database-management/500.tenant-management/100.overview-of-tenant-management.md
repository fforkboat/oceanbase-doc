Overview of tenant management 
==================================================

OceanBase Database supports multitenancy. Tenants in OceanBase Database are similar to database instances of traditional databases. You can create databases under a tenant and create tables in the databases of tenants. 

OceanBase Database supports MySQL tenants only. OceanBase Database supports multi-tenant isolation. You can allocate isolated resources, such as CPU, memory, IOPS, and disk space, to each tenant. Each OceanBase cluster has a built-in system tenant sys. The sys tenant is used to manage clusters. You can also bind tenants by grouping them. The resources of a cluster are managed in a resource pool and can be allocated to tenants. You can configure the resources and the resource pool to manage tenant resources. 

OceanBase Database supports minor compaction, partition leader switchover, and resource scaling at the tenant level.
