Overview of memory management 
==================================================



OceanBase Database is a standard memory-level distributed database that supports the multi-tenant architecture. Therefore, it imposes high requirements on the management and use of large-capacity memory. OceanBase Database occupies most memory of servers and manages the memory in a unified manner. You can create a tenant for a new service to be launched and allocate CPU and memory resources to the tenant based on the service scale. When the allocatable CPU and memory resources are insufficient, you can scale out the OceanBase cluster to meet up with the requirements of the ever growing business.
