As shown in the preceding figure, OceanBase Database occupies most memory of OBServers (OBServer total memory), in which some memory resources(memory reserved for OBServer) are used for system running and some memory resources (allocatable memory for OBServer) are allocated to created tenants. Each tenant is equivalent to an instance of a traditional database. Memory modules of different tenants are the same and include memstores (tenant memstores) for storing incremental data and KVCache (Tenant Cache Memory).
