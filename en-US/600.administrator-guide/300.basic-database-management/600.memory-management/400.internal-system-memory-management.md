Internal system memory management 
======================================================



OceanBase Database supports the multi-tenancy architecture. However, not all the memory configured for the OceanBase database can be allocated to tenants, because tenants share some resources and features on each OBServer. As the memory occupied by the shared resources and features does not belong to any common tenant, this type of memory is considered the internal system memory. You can set `system_memory` to specify the maximum internal system memory available. This parameter specifies the maximum memory of the OceanBase database that can be internally used by the system. 

Assume that the maximum memory size for the OceanBase database is 80 GB and `system_memory` is 20 GB, the memory that can be assigned to tenants is only 60 GB.
