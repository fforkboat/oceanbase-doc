About tables 
=================================

This topic describes the definition and design principles of tables. 

Tables are the most basic data storage units in OceanBase Database. A table contains all the data that a user can access. A table consists of rows, and a row consists of columns. 

Plan before you create and use tables. Obey the principles that follow when planning:

* Use the table based on the standard procedures and use a reasonable table structure to minimize data redundancy.

  

* Select the suitable SQL data type for each column. 

  For more information about the SQL data types, see OceanBase DataBase SQL Reference.
  

* Choose a suitable table type based on your needs. OceanBase Database supports partitioned and non-partitioned tables.
