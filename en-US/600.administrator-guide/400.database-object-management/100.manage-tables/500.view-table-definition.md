View table definition 
==========================================

After a table is created, you can use an SQL statement to view the creation statement that defines the table. 

In MySQL mode, you can use the `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statement to view the definition of a table. 

Example:

```sql
obclient> SHOW CREATE TABLE test;
```
