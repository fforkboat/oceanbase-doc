Delete a table 
===================================

When you no longer need a table, you can use the `DROP TABLE` statement to delete it. 

MySQL mode 
-------------------------------

You can execute either of the following statements to delete a table:

```sql
obclient> DROP TABLE test;
```



or

```sql
obclient> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test;
```



If you specify `EXISTS` when you drop a table, no error is reported even if the table to be deleted does not exist. Otherwise, an error is reported.

Operating instructions 
-------------------------------------------

For the `DROP TABLE` operation:

* If recycle bin is disabled, the `DROP TABLE` operation deletes the table. You can set the `recyclebin` parameter to enable or disable recycle bin. By default, recycle bin is disabled.

  

* If recycle bin is enabled, the table dropped by the `DROP TABLE` operation is moved to the recycle bin. Tables in the recycle bin can be permanently deleted or recovered. For more information about the recycle bin, see [Recycle bin for databases, tables, and indexes](../../800.high-data-availability/100.recycle-bin-management/200.recycle-bin-for-databases-tables-and-indexes.md).
