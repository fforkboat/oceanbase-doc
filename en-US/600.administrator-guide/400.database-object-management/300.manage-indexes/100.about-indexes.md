About indexes 
==================================



After you create a table, you can create an index on one or more columns in the table to speed up the execution of SQL statements on the table. Well-designed indexes can reduce physical or logical I/O operations. 

Tables in OceanBase Database are clustered index tables. If you do not specify a primary key for a table, the system automatically generates a hidden primary key for the table.
