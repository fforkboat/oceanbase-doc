View an index 
==================================

This topic describes how you can view indexes. 

In MySQL mode, you can use the `SHOW INDEX `statement to view the indexes on a table. 

For example, the following statement queries the indexes on the test table: 

```sql
obclient> SHOW INDEX FROM test;
```
