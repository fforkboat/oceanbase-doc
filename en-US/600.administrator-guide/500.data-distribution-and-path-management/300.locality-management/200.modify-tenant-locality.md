Modify tenant locality 
===========================================



To modify the locality of a tenant, use the following syntax:

```sql
ALTER TENANT 'TENANT_NAME' SET LOCALITY = locality
```



For example, the following statement changes the locality of test_tenant to `F{1}@z1,F{1}@z2,F{1}@z3,F{1}@z4`:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TENANT test_tenant set locality = 'F{1}@z1,F{1}@z2,F{1}@z3,F{1}@z4';
```



Before you change the locality of a tenant, verify the state of the resource units and the resource pool in the target zone. If the OBServers in the target zone do not have enough resources to store the new resources from the tenant, the locality cannot be changed.
