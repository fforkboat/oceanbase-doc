Users and privileges 
=========================================



OceanBase Database users are divided into two categories: users under a system tenant and users under a common tenant. When you create a user, if the current session is under a system tenant, the created user is a user under the system tenant. Otherwise, the user is a user under a common tenant. 

Common tenants can be in MySQL mode only, and are hereinafter referred to as MySQL tenants. 

User names under a tenant must be unique. However, they can be duplicated under different tenants. A tenant can be globally uniquely identified by the combination of `username@tenant name`. We recommend that you add a prefix to usernames of users under a system tenant to distinguish them from users under a common tenant. Both the system tenants and common tenants are configured with an internal administrator user. The administrator user of a MySQL tenant is root. The root user for a system tenant is a system administrator, and the root user for a common tenant is a tenant administrator. You can use the root account and password of a common tenant to manage the tenant. 

MySQL tenants 
----------------------------------

Users under a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database have access only to the objects under the tenant, and the privileges for the users are compatible with those of MySQL. 

The following table lists the privileges in OceanBase Database in MySQL mode.
