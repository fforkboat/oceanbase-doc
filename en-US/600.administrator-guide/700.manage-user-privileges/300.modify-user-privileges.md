Modify user privileges 
===========================================

This topic describes how to modify privileges for an OceanBase database user. 

Note 
-------------------------

For privilege grants:

* Before you grant privileges to a user, make sure that the user that you have logged on to has the privileges to be granted and the `GRANT OPTION` privilege.

  

* The user to which the privileges are granted needs to reconnect to the OceanBase database for the newly granted privileges to take effect.

  




For privilege revocation:

* The user that you have logged on to must have the privileges to be revoked and the `GRANT OPTION` privilege.

  

* To revoke the `ALL PRIVILEGES` and `GRANT OPTION` privilege, the user that you have logged on to must have the global `GRANT OPTION` privilege or the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` privileges on the table.

  

* Privilege revocation does not extend to other users. For example, if `user1` has granted some privileges to `user2`, when you revoke the privileges of `user1`, the privileges granted by user 1 to `user2` are not revoked.

  




Grant or revoke privileges using SQL statements 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* MySQL mode

  The user privilege management syntax in MySQL mode is as follows:

  ```sql
  grant_stmt:
      GRANT privilege_type_list ON privilege_level TO user_option_list [WITH GRANT OPTION];
  
  revoke_stmt:
      REVOKE privilege_type_list ON privilege_level FROM user_name_list;
  
  show_grants_stmt:
      SHOW GRANTS [FOR user_name];
  
  privilege_type_list:
      {ALL [PRIVILEGES] | privilege_type [, privilege_type ...]}
  
  privilege_type:
        ALTER
      | CREATE
      | CREATE USER
      | CREATE VIEW
      | DELETE
      | DROP
      | GRANT OPTION
      | INDEX
      | INSERT
      | PROCESS
      | SELECT
      | SHOW DATABASES
      | SHOW VIEW
      | SUPER
      | UPDATE
      | USAGE
  
  privilege_level:
        *
      | *.*
      | database_name.*
      | database_name.table_name
      | table_name
  
  user_option_list:
      user_option [, user_option ...]
  
  user_option:
      user_name [IDENTIFIED BY 'password']
  
  password:
      STR_VALUE
  
  user_name_list:
      user_name [, user_name ...]
  ```

  

  Examples:
  * Grant privileges

    ```sql
    obclient> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO demo WITH GRANT OPTION;
    ```

    
  
  * Revoke privileges

    ```sql
    obclient> REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION FROM 'demo';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
    ```
