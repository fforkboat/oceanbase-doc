Objects supported by the recycle bin 
=========================================================



The recycle bin stores objects such as databases and tables deleted by the user. The recycle bin is equivalent to a data dictionary table for storing information about objects deleted by the user. Objects in the recycle bin still occupy physical space unless they are manually purged or periodically deleted by the system. 

The recycle bin feature is provided since OceanBase V1.0.0. 

The following table describes the objects supported by the recycle bin. 


| **Mode**  | **Index** | **Table** | **Database** | **Tenant** |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **MySQL** | √         | √         | √            | √          |


**Notice**



* System tables deleted by the`TRUNCATE` or `DROP` operation are not stored in the recycle bin.

  

* Indexes deleted by the `TRUNCATE` or `DROP` operation are not stored in the recycle bin.

  

* You can perform only read operations such as `SELECT` on the objects in the recycle bin but cannot perform write operations such as data manipulation language (DML) or data definition language (DDL) operations on them.

  

* Only the tenant administrator can manage the recycle bin.
