Deploy NFS 
===============================

This topic describes how to deploy NFS as the backup destination. 

Background 
-------------------------------

We recommend that you use OSS devices or dedicated NFS devices, for example, NFS devices provided by Alibaba Cloud.

Deploy the NFS server 
------------------------------------------

1. Log on to the NFS server.

   

2. Run the following command to install NFS by using the YUM package manager. 

   ```shell
   sudo yum install nfs-utils
   ```

   

3. Configure the exports file. 

   1. Run the `sudo vim /``etc/exports` command to access the configuration file and set the following information:

      ```shell
      /data/nfs_server/ 100.xx.xx.xx/16(rw,sync,all_squash)
      ```

      

      `100.``xx.xx.xx` indicates the accessible CIDR block.
      
   
   2. Run the following command to grant privileges to `nfsnobody`, allowing `nfsnobody` to access the directory specified in the `exports` file. 

      ```shell
      sudo chown nfsnobody:nfsnobody -R /data/nfs_server
      ```

      
   

   

4. Set the NFS parameters. 

   1. Run the `sudo vim /etc/sysconfig/nfs` command to access the configuration file.

      
   
   2. Set the parameters as follows:

      ```unknow
      RPCNFSDCOUNT=8
      RPCNFSDARGS="-N 2 -N 3 -U"
      NFSD_V4_GRACE=90
      NFSD_V4_LEASE=90
      ```

      
   
   3. Run the following command to restart NFS. 

      ```shell
      sudo systemctl restart nfs-config
      
      sudo systemctl restart nfs-server
      ```

      
   

   

5. Set the slot table. 

   1. Run the `sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf` command to access the `sysctl.conf` file and add the following information:

      ```xml
      sunrpc.tcp_max_slot_table_entries=128
      ```

      
   
   2. Restart the server for the configurations to take effect.

      
   

   




Deploy the NFS client 
------------------------------------------

The NFS client must be deployed on all OBServers. 

This section describes how to deploy the NFS client on an OBServer. 

1. Log on to the OBServer.

   

2. Run the following command to install NFS by using the YUM package manager. 

   ```shell
   sudo yum install nfs-utils
   ```

   

3. Set the slot table. 

   1. Run the `sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf` command to access the `sysctl.conf` file and add the following information:

      ```xml
      sunrpc.tcp_max_slot_table_entries=128
      ```

      
   
   2. Restart the server for the configurations to take effect.

      
   

   

4. Run the following command to mount NFS. 

   ```shell
   sudo mount -tnfs4 -o rw,timeo=30,wsize=1048576,rsize=1048576,namlen=512,sync,lookupcache=positive 100.xx.xx.xx:/data/nfs_server /data/nfs
   ```

   
   **Note**

   
   * We recommend that you set `timeo` to an appropriate value.

     
   
   * `100.xx.xx.xx` indicates the IP address of the NFS server.

     
   

   
   

5. Run the following command to verify the performance of NFS. 

   ```shell
   fio -filename=/data/nfs/fio_test -direct=1  -rw=randwrite -bs=2048K -size=100G  -runtime=300 -group_reporting -name=mytest  -ioengine=libaio -numjobs=1 -iodepth=64 -iodepth_batch=8 -iodepth_low=8 -iodepth_batch_complete=8
   ```

   

   For example, the command output is as follows:

   ```shell
   Run status group 0 (all jobs):
   WRITE: io=322240MB, aggrb=1074.2MB/s, minb=1074.2MB/s, maxb=1074.2MB/s, mint=300006msec, maxt=300006msec
   ```

   




Note 
-------------------------

* If you use an NFS environment, make sure that you have mounted NFS before enabling the backup service. If NFS fails during backup, stop data backup and log backup first and then resolve the NFS issue.

  

* When you restart an OBServer, you need to start NFS first.

  

* After you add a new server, make sure that you have mounted NFS or you are able to back up data to another media before you start the new OBServer.
