Delete expired backups 
===========================================

This topic describes how to manually delete expired backups. 

If you have specified `auto_delete_expired_backup=true`, the backup and restoration feature checks for expired backups based on the setting of recovery_window and automatically deletes expired backups. You can also delete a specified backup by running the following command: 

```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM DELETE BACKUPSET backupset_id;
```
