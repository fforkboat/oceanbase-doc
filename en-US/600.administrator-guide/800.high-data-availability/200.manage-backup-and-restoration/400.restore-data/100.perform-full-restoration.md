Perform full restoration 
=============================================

This topic describes how to restore data by using commands. OceanBase Database supports tenant-level point-in-time full restoration. 

Restore data by using commands 
---------------------------------------------------

You can run the corresponding commands to restore full backup data from the backup destination, incorporate incremental backup data to the full backup data, and then apply the backup transaction logs. 

1. Log on to the database as the root user of the sys tenant.

   

2. Run the following command to disable log backup (optional): 

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM NOARCHIVELOG;
   ```

   
   **Note**

   

   Versions earlier than V2.2.7x do not support running restoration tasks on a cluster that has log backup enabled because restoration interrupts log backup. We recommend that you disable log backup before starting data restoration on versions earlier than V2.2.7x.
   

3. Create a resource unit. 

   Example:

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE RESOURCE UNIT box_16c96g max_cpu 16, max_memory 103079215104, max_iops 10240, max_disk_size 53687091200, max_session_num 64, MIN_CPU=16, MIN_MEMORY=103079215104, MIN_IOPS=10240;
   ```

   

4. Create a resource pool. 

   Example:

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE RESOURCE POOL restore_pool unit = 'box_16c96g', unit_num = 1, zone_list = ('z1','z2','z3');
   ```

   

5. Run the following command to configure encryption information: 

   **Note**

   

   If the data is not encrypted or the original KMS is available, skip this step.

   ```sql
   obclient> SET @kms_encrypt_info = '<encryption string>';
   ```

   

   `<encryption string>` is the value of `EXTERNAL_KMS_INFO`. `EXTERNAL_KMS_INFO` is a tenant-specific configuration item.
   

6. Verify restoration configurations. 

   Check whether `restore_concurrency` is `0`. If yes, run the following command:

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET restore_concurrency = 50;
   ```

   

7. Modify the restoration idle time. This step is optional. 

   `_restore_idle_time` is 1 minute by default. The restoration procedure contains three idle periods, which are 3 minutes in total. To reduce the wait time during restoration performance testing, you can run the following command to shorten the idle time to `10s`: 

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET _restore_idle_time = '10s';
   ```

   

8. Run the following command to set a restoration password as required: 

   ```sql
   obclient> SET DECRYPTION IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   ```

   

   A restoration password is required only when a password has been specified during backup. If the passwords for full backup and incremental backup are different, multiple passwords must be entered and separated with commas (,). Example:

   ```sql
   obclient> SET DECRYPTION IDENTIFIED BY 'password1', 'password2';
   ```

   

9. Run the following command to start the restoration task: 

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE <dest_tenant_name> FROM <source_tenan_tname> at 'uri' UNTIL 'timestamp' WITH 'restore_option';
   ```

   

   The following table describes the parameters.

When the value is `true`, the value of `kms_encrypt_info` specified in Step 5 is required for restoration.    |

   

   Sample commands:
   * NFS

     ```

     
   
   * OSS

     ```sql
     obclient> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE restored_trade FROM trade at 'oss://antsys-oceanbasebackup/backup_rd/?host=cn-hangzhou-alipay-b.oss-cdn.aliyun-inc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx' until ' 2020-03-23 08:59:45' with 'backup_cluster_name=ob20daily.backup&backup_cluster_id=1&pool_list=restore_pool';
     ```

      Valid values of `is_restore`:
      * 0: indicates a normal replica.

        
      
      * 1: indicates a logically restored replica.

        
      
      * 2: indicates a physically restored replica that requires the restoration of the baseline data.

        
      
      * 3: indicates a physically restored replica that requires the restoration of minor compaction data.

        
      
      * 4: indicates a physically restored replica that requires the restoration of clogs.

        
      
      * 5: indicates a physically restored replica that requires a minor compaction.

        
      
      * 6: indicates a physically restored replica that waits for the minor compactions of all replicas to complete.

        
      
      * 7: indicates a physically restored replica that contains a member list.

        
      

      

      Valid values of `role`: 
      * 1: indicates a leader.

        
      
      * 2: indicates a follower.

        
      
      * 3: indicates a leader in restoration.

        
      

      
    
    * View the restoration progress of the meta table:

      ```sql
      obclient> SELECT svr_ip,role, is_restore, COUNT(*) FROM __all_virtual_meta_table AS a, (SELECT value FROM __all_restore_info WHERE name='tenant_id') AS b WHERE a.tenant_id=b.value GROUP BY role, is_restore, svr_ip ORDER BY svr_ip, is_restore;
      ```

      

      or

      ```sql
      obclient> SELECT svr_ip ,is_restore, COUNT(*) FROM __all_virtual_partition_store_info WHERE tenant_id>1002 group by svr_ip,is_restore order by svr_ip, is_restore;
      ```

      
      
    

    

11. Run the following commands to view the restoration results: 

    ```sql
    obclient> SELECT * FROM __all_restore_info;
    ```

    

    ```sql
    obclient> SELECT * FROM __all_restore_history;
    ```
