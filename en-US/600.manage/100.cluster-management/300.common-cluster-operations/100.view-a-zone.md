# View a zone

An OceanBase cluster consists of several zones. A zone is usually an independent physical deployment unit, which can be an Internet Data Center (IDC), a node in a cloud, or an independent rack. You can deploy your OceanBase cluster across different zones to implement fault isolation and quick recovery when a zone fails.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   Run the following command to log on. You must replace the related information in the command based on the actual database environment.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys -p***** -A
   ```

   For more information about how to connect to OceanBase Database, see [Overview](../../../3.develop/1.application-development-of-mysql-mode/1.database-connection-with-client-of-mysql-mode/1.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md) of the Connect to OceanBase Database chapter in Develop Applications in MySQL Mode and [Overview](../../../3.develop/2.application-development-of-oracle-mode/1.database-connection-of-oracle-mode/1.connection-methods-overview-of-oracle-mode.md) of the Connect to OceanBase Database chapter in Develop Applications in Oracle Mode.

2. Query the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES` view for information about zones in the cluster.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES;
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+-----+----------+-----------+
   | ZONE  | CREATE_TIME                | MODIFY_TIME                | STATUS   | IDC | REGION   | TYPE      |
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+-----+----------+-----------+
   | zone1 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.168745 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.801054 | ACTIVE   | HZ0 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone2 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.168745 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.809504 | ACTIVE   | HZ0 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone3 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.169804 | 2023-01-11 17:28:57.211079 | ACTIVE   | HZ1 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone4 | 2023-01-06 15:30:30.887362 | 2023-01-06 15:30:30.888420 | INACTIVE | hz1 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+-----+----------+-----------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

   Fields in the query result are as follows:

   * `ZONE`: the name of the zone.

   * `STATUS`: the status of the zone. Valid values:

      * `ACTIVE`:The zone is available.

      * `INACTIVE`: The zone is unavailable. The client detects this state and routes the business workflow to another zone.

         For a new zone or a zone on which you have run an isolation command (Stop Zone, Force Stop Zone, or Isolate Zone), its status will change to `INACTIVE`. This situation usually occurs during fault isolation or O&M changes.

   * `IDC`: the name of the IDC where the zone is located.

   * `REGION`: the region where the zone is located. The value is usually a city name such as Shanghai or a region name such as East China.

   * `TYPE`: the type of the zone. `ReadWrite` indicates that the zone is a read-write zone. The current database version supports only read-write zones.
