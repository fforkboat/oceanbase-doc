# User tenants

A user tenant is like a general database management system. It is equivalent to a database instance. User tenants are created in the sys tenant based on business needs. The characteristics of a user tenant are the same as that of a database instance. Major characteristics include:

* Users can be created in a user tenant.
* All objects such as databases (supported only in MySQL mode) and tables can be created in a user tenant.
* A user tenant has a separate set of system tables and system views.
* A user tenant has a separate set of system variables.
* A user tenant has other characteristics of a database instance.

The metadata of all user data is stored in user tenants. Each tenant is assigned a unique namespace that is isolated from other namespaces. The sys tenant manages all user tenants. 
<!-- The following figure shows the hierarchy between the sys tenant and user tenants. -->

Users that are created in a user tenant can log on only to this user tenant and are invisible to other tenants.

* You can query the `mysql.user` view for information about MySQL tenants.
* You can query the `ALL_USERS` view for information about Oracle tenants.

The tables created in a user tenant are invisible to other tenants.

* You can query the `information_schema.tables` view for information about all user tables in a MySQL tenant.
* You can query the `ALL_TABLES` view for information about all user tables in an Oracle tenant.

A user tenant can modify only its own system variables.

* You can query the `information_schema.global_variables` and `information_schema.session_variables` views for system variables of a MySQL tenant. You can also execute the `SHOW VARIABLES` statement to query the system variables of a MySQL tenant.
* You can execute the `SHOW VARIABLES` statement to query the system variables of an Oracle tenant.
