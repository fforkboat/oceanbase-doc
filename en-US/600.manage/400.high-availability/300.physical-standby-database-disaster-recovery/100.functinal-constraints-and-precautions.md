# Limitations

This topic describes the limitations on the Physical Standby Database feature.

| Item | Description |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Number of standby tenants | Unlimited |
| Heterogeneity of the primary and standby tenants | <ul><li>The primary and standby tenants must use the same unit config. If they use different CPU or memory configurations, stability issues may arise. </li><li>The primary and standby tenants must have the same `UNIT_NUM` value. </li></ul> |
| Synchronization of parameter modifications between the primary and standby tenants | The parameters of the primary tenant are independent of those of a standby tenant, and parameter modifications are not physically synchronized. After you modify a parameter for the primary tenant, you must assess whether to modify this parameter for the standby tenants.  |
| Synchronization of system variable modifications between the primary and standby tenants | After a system variable is modified in the primary tenant, the modification is synchronized to the standby tenants.  |
| Operations in standby tenants | <ul><li>A standby tenant supports strong-consistency reads and weak-consistency reads, but does not support writes. </li><li>You can trigger only minor compactions and cannot trigger major compactions for a standby tenant. Standby tenants synchronize major compaction information from the primary tenant. </li></ul> |
| Switchover | <ul><li>To change the role of a standby tenant to PRIMARY, make sure that all servers are online. </li><li>Before you change the role of a standby tenant to PRIMARY, make sure that this standby tenant has been synchronized with the primary tenant. </li></ul> |
| Failover | Make sure that all servers in the cluster to which the standby tenant belongs are online.  |
