# Overview

OceanBase Database provides two tenant roles: PRIMARY and STANDBY. You can perform a switchover or a failover to dynamically switch the roles of tenants. 

* Switchover

   You can switch roles of the primary tenant and one of the standby tenants without data loss. 

* Failover

   If the primary tenant becomes unavailable, you can switch one of the standby tenants to the PRIMARY role.
