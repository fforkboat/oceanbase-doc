# Enable the arbitration service

OceanBase Database allows you to enable the arbitration service for a tenant when you create the tenant. You can also enable the arbitration service for a tenant after the tenant is created. This topic describes how to enable the arbitration service for an existing tenant.

## Prerequisites

* The arbitration service has been deployed in the cluster where the tenant resides. 
  <!-- For more information about how to deploy the arbitration service, see **Step 4: Enable and add the arbitration service** in [Deploy an OceanBase cluster with two replicas and the arbitration service](../../../4.deploy/3.deploy-oceanbase-database-enterprise/4.command-line-deployment/3.deploy-the-oceanbase-cluster-command-line/2.deploy-the-quorum-high-availability-service.md). -->

* The tenant must have two or four full-featured replicas.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding fields in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys -p***** -A
   ```

   For more information about how to connect to a database, see [Database connection overview (MySQL mode)](../../../3.develop/1.application-development-of-mysql-mode/1.database-connection-with-client-of-mysql-mode/1.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md) or [Database connection overview (Oracle mode)](../../../3.develop/2.application-development-of-oracle-mode/1.database-connection-of-oracle-mode/1.connection-methods-overview-of-oracle-mode.md).

2. Execute the following statement to query the arbitration service status of the tenant.

   Sample statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM DBA_OB_TENANTS WHERE tenant_name = 'oracle001';
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
                    TENANT_ID: 1004
                  TENANT_NAME: oracle001
                  TENANT_TYPE: USER
                  CREATE_TIME: 2023-02-06 13:38:27.626314
                  MODIFY_TIME: 2023-02-06 13:38:45.005930
                 PRIMARY_ZONE: zone1
                     LOCALITY: FULL{1}@zone1
            PREVIOUS_LOCALITY: NULL
           COMPATIBILITY_MODE: ORACLE
                       STATUS: NORMAL
                IN_RECYCLEBIN: NO
                       LOCKED: NO
                  TENANT_ROLE: PRIMARY
            SWITCHOVER_STATUS: NORMAL
             SWITCHOVER_EPOCH: 0
                     SYNC_SCN: 1677665769026296752
               REPLAYABLE_SCN: 1677665769026296752
                 READABLE_SCN: 1677665768858323118
           RECOVERY_UNTIL_SCN: 4611686018427387903
                     LOG_MODE: NOARCHIVELOG
   ARBITRATION_SERVICE_STATUS: DISABLED
   1 row in set
   ```

   The arbitration service status of the tenant can be:

   * `ENABLED`: The arbitration service is enabled for the tenant.

   * `DISABLED`: The arbitration service is disabled for the tenant.

   * `ENABLING`: The arbitration service is being enabled for the tenant.

   * `DISABLING`: The arbitration service is being disabled for the tenant.

   The preceding query result shows that the value of the `ARBITRATION_SERVICE_STATUS` field is `DISABLED`, which indicates that the arbitration service is disabled for the tenant.

   For more information about the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view, see [DBA_OB_TENANTS](../../../7.reference/5.system-reference/4.system-overview-of-mysql-mode/2.dictionary-view-of-mysql-mode/58.oceanbase-dba_ob_tenants-of-mysql-mode.md).

3. Execute the following statement to enable the arbitration service for the tenant:

   Syntax:

   ```sql
   ALTER TENANT tenant_name [SET] ENABLE_ARBITRATION_SERVICE = true;
   ```

   The `tenant_name` field specifies the name of the tenant for which you want to enable the arbitration service. The `SET` keyword is optional.

   The following sample statement enables the arbitration service for a tenant named `oracle001`:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER TENANT oracle001 ENABLE_ARBITRATION_SERVICE = true;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

4. Query the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS` view to verify whether the arbitration service is enabled for the tenant.

   Sample statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM DBA_OB_TENANTS WHERE tenant_name = 'oracle001';
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
                    TENANT_ID: 1004
                  TENANT_NAME: oracle001
                  TENANT_TYPE: USER
                  CREATE_TIME: 2023-02-06 13:38:27.626314
                  MODIFY_TIME: 2023-02-06 13:38:45.005930
                 PRIMARY_ZONE: zone1
                     LOCALITY: FULL{1}@zone1
            PREVIOUS_LOCALITY: NULL
           COMPATIBILITY_MODE: ORACLE
                       STATUS: NORMAL
                IN_RECYCLEBIN: NO
                       LOCKED: NO
                  TENANT_ROLE: PRIMARY
            SWITCHOVER_STATUS: NORMAL
             SWITCHOVER_EPOCH: 0
                     SYNC_SCN: 1677665769026296752
               REPLAYABLE_SCN: 1677665769026296752
                 READABLE_SCN: 1677665768858323118
           RECOVERY_UNTIL_SCN: 4611686018427387903
                     LOG_MODE: NOARCHIVELOG
   ARBITRATION_SERVICE_STATUS: ENABLED
   1 row in set
   ```

   The preceding query result shows that the value of the `ARBITRATION_SERVICE_STATUS` field is `ENABLED`, which indicates that the arbitration service is enabled for the tenant.

5.  After you enable the arbitration service, the existing log streams of the tenant can use the arbitration service, but the new log streams created after the arbitration service is enabled may lack arbitration members and cannot be upgraded or downgraded. This is because a log stream is created in non-strict mode and the arbitration member may not be created. You can execute the following statement to verify whether all log streams of the tenant have arbitration members.

   Syntax:

   ```sql
(SELECT distinct ls_id FROM GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE tenant_id = tenantid) EXCEPT
   (SELECT ls_id FROM GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE tenant_id = tenantid AND role = 'LEADER' AND arbitration_member = 'arb_server_ip:arb_server_port');
   ```
   
   Parameters:

   * `tenantid`: the ID of the tenant for which the arbitration service is enabled.

   * `arb_server_ip`: the IP address of the server on which the arbitration service is deployed.

   * `arb_server_port`: the remote procedure call (RPC) port for the arbitration service. By default, Port 2882 is used.


   Sample statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> (SELECT distinct ls_id FROM GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE tenant_id = 1004) EXCEPT
   (SELECT ls_id FROM GV$OB_LOG_STAT where tenant_id = 1004 and role = 'LEADER' and arbitration_member = '100.xx.xx.xx:2882');
   Empty set
   ```

   For more information about the fields in the `GV$OB_LOG_STAT` view, see [GV$OB_LOG_STAT](../../../7.reference/5.system-reference/4.system-overview-of-mysql-mode/3.performance-view-of-mysql-mode/114.gv-ob_log_stat-of-mysql-mode.md).

   If the query result is empty, all log streams have arbitration members, and the arbitration service is available. Otherwise, Root Service will add arbitration members to log streams that lack arbitration members in the background. You can check whether an arbitration member addition task is running by querying the `CDB_OB_LS_ARB_REPLICA_TASKS` view.

   After the task is completed, you can query the `CDB_OB_LS_ARB_REPLICA_TASK_HISTORY` view to confirm the task execution result. If the task succeeded, arbitration members are added to log streams, and the arbitration service is available. If the task failed, contact OceanBase Technical Support for assistance.
