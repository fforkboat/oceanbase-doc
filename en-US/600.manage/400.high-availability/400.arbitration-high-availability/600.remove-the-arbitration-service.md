# Remove the arbitration service

If you no longer need the arbitration service, you can remove it from the cluster.

## Prerequisites

The arbitration service is disabled for all tenants. Otherwise, an error will be reported when you remove the arbitration service. For more information, see [Disable the arbitration service](3.disable-the-arbitration-service.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding fields in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys -p***** -A
   ```

   For more information about how to connect to a database, see [Database connection overview (MySQL mode)](../../../3.develop/1.application-development-of-mysql-mode/1.database-connection-with-client-of-mysql-mode/1.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md) or [Database connection overview (Oracle mode)](../../../3.develop/2.application-development-of-oracle-mode/1.database-connection-of-oracle-mode/1.connection-methods-overview-of-oracle-mode.md).

2. Execute the following statement to remove the arbitration service:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM REMOVE ARBITRATION SERVICE 'arb_server_ip:arb_server_port';
   ```

   Parameters:

   * `arb_server_ip`: the IP address of the server from which the arbitration service is removed.

   * `arb_server_port`: the remote procedure call (RPC) port for the arbitration service to be removed. By default, Port 2882 is used.

   Sample statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM REMOVE ARBITRATION SERVICE '100.xx.xx.xx:2882';
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

## What to do next

If you want to use the arbitration service after you remove it, you must redeploy the arbitration service. 
<!-- For more information about how to deploy the arbitration service, see **Step 4: Enable and add the arbitration service** in [Deploy an OceanBase cluster with two replicas and the arbitration service](../../../4.deploy/3.deploy-oceanbase-database-enterprise/4.command-line-deployment/3.deploy-the-oceanbase-cluster-command-line/2.deploy-the-quorum-high-availability-service.md). -->
