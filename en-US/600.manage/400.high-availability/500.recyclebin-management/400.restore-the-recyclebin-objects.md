# Restore objects from the recycle bin

You can execute the `FLASHBACK` statement to restore objects from the recycle bin.

## Considerations

* The order of flashing back objects must comply with their dependency. A database is flashed back before tables in the database.

* Indexes cannot be restored directly. When you execute the `FLASHBACK` statement to restore a table, indexes on the table are restored together with the table.

* You can modify the name of an object when you restore it from the recycle bin, but the object name must be different from an existing one. Otherwise, the system returns an error.

* If the database of a MySQL tenant is deleted, before you restore a table from the recycle bin, restore the database first.

* If a table in the recycle bin originally belongs to a group, it is restored to the group by default. If the group is deleted, the restored table does not belong to any group.

## Restore tenants

You can delete tenants only in the `sys` tenant. Therefore, you can restore tenants from the recycle bin only in the `sys` tenant. You can modify the name of a tenant when you restore it from the recycle bin, but the tenant name must be different from an existing one. Otherwise, the system returns an error.

1. Log on to the database as an administrator of the `sys` tenant.

   Example (the command can vary in practice):

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys -p***** -A
   ```

   For more information, see [Database connection overview](../../../3.develop/1.application-development-of-mysql-mode/1.database-connection-with-client-of-mysql-mode/1.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).

2. Execute the `SHOW RECYCLEBIN` statement to query for the names of objects in the recycle bin.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SHOW RECYCLEBIN;
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------+----------------------------+
   | OBJECT_NAME                         | ORIGINAL_NAME     | TYPE     | CREATETIME                 |
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------+----------------------------+
   | RECYCLE_$_100017_1672050541224936   | oracle001         | TENANT   | 2023-01-16 11:01:40.258000 |
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673426335319344 | __idx_500788_idx1 | INDEX    | 2023-01-11 16:38:55.318878 |
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673426335331800 | t1                | TABLE    | 2023-01-11 16:38:55.331481 |
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673854707660504 | infotest          | DATABASE | 2023-01-16 15:38:27.660436 |
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------+----------------------------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

3. Restore a tenant from the recycle bin in an appropriate way based on your business needs.

   * Restore a tenant from the recycle bin to a regular tenant with the original name.

      Sample statement:

      ```sql
      FLASHBACK TENANT tenant_name TO BEFORE DROP;
      ```

      `tenant_name` specifies the name of the tenant in the recycle bin or the original name of the tenant. The name in the recycle bin is globally unique and therefore can accurately specify the tenant to be restored. We recommend that you use the name in the recycle bin to restore the tenant. If you use the original name and multiple tenants in the recycle bin have the same original name, the last tenant moved to the recycle bin is restored.

      Example:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> FLASHBACK TENANT RECYCLE_$_100017_1672050541224936 TO BEFORE DROP;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

   * Restore a tenant in the recycle bin to a regular tenant and rename it.

      ```sql
      FLASHBACK TENANT tenant_name TO BEFORE DROP RENAME TO new_tenant_name;
      ```

      Parameters:

      * `tenant_name` specifies the name of the tenant in the recycle bin or the original name of the tenant. The name in the recycle bin is globally unique and therefore can accurately specify the tenant to be restored. We recommend that you use the name in the recycle bin to restore the tenant. If you use the original name and multiple tenants in the recycle bin have the same original name, the last tenant moved to the recycle bin is restored.

      * `new_tenant_name` specifies the new name of the tenant after it is restored from the recycle bin.

      Example:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> FLASHBACK TENANT RECYCLE_$_100017_1672050541224936 TO BEFORE DROP RENAME TO new_oracle;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

## Restore databases

You can restore databases from the recycle bin in the `sys` tenant or a MySQL user tenant. You can modify the name of a database when you restore it from the recycle bin, but the database name must be different from an existing one. Otherwise, the system returns an error.

1. Log on to the database as an administrator of the `sys` tenant or a MySQL user tenant.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>The default administrator user of a MySQL user tenant is <code>root</code>. </p>
   </main>

   Example (the command can vary in practice):

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys -p***** -A
   ```

   For more information, see [Database connection overview](../../../3.develop/1.application-development-of-mysql-mode/1.database-connection-with-client-of-mysql-mode/1.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).

2. Execute the `SHOW RECYCLEBIN` statement to query for the names of objects in the recycle bin.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SHOW RECYCLEBIN;
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------+----------------------------+
   | OBJECT_NAME                         | ORIGINAL_NAME     | TYPE     | CREATETIME                 |
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------+----------------------------+
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673426335319344 | __idx_500788_idx1 | INDEX    | 2023-01-11 16:38:55.318878 |
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673426335331800 | t1                | TABLE    | 2023-01-11 16:38:55.331481 |
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673854707660504 | infotest          | DATABASE | 2023-01-16 15:38:27.660436 |
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------+----------------------------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

3. Restore a database from the recycle bin in an appropriate way based on your business needs.

   * Restore a database from the recycle bin and keep the original name of the database.

      ```sql
      FLASHBACK DATABASE object_name TO BEFORE DROP;
      ```

      `object_name` specifies the name of the database in the recycle bin. You cannot set this parameter to the original name of the database.

      If the name of the database to be restored is the same as that of an existing database, the system returns an error after you execute the statement.

      Example:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> FLASHBACK DATABASE __recycle_$_100017_1673854707660504 TO BEFORE DROP;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

   * Restore a database from the recycle bin and rename it.

      ```sql
      FLASHBACK DATABASE object_name TO BEFORE DROP RENAME TO new_database_name;
      ```
      
      Parameters:
      
      * `object_name` specifies the name of the database in the recycle bin. You cannot set this parameter to the original name of the database.
      
      * `new_database_name` specifies the new name of the database after it is restored from the recycle bin.
      
      Example:
      
      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> FLASHBACK DATABASE __recycle_$_100017_1673854707660504 TO BEFORE DROP RENAME TO new_infotest;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```
      
      

## Restore tables

You can restore tables from the recycle bin in the `sys` tenant, a MySQL user tenant, or an Oracle user tenant. You can modify the name of a table when you restore it from the recycle bin, but the table name must be different from an existing one. Otherwise, the system returns an error.

1. Log on to the database as an administrator of the `sys` tenant or a user tenant.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>The default administrator user of a MySQL user tenant is <code>root</code> and that of an Oracle user tenant is <code>SYS</code>. </p>
   </main>

   Example (the command can vary in practice):

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys -p***** -A
   ```

   For more information, see [Database connection overview](../../../3.develop/1.application-development-of-mysql-mode/1.database-connection-with-client-of-mysql-mode/1.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).

2. Execute the `SHOW RECYCLEBIN` statement to query for the names of objects in the recycle bin.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SHOW RECYCLEBIN;
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------+----------------------------+
   | OBJECT_NAME                         | ORIGINAL_NAME     | TYPE     | CREATETIME                 |
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------+----------------------------+
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673426335319344 | __idx_500788_idx1 | INDEX    | 2023-01-11 16:38:55.318878 |
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673426335331800 | t1                | TABLE    | 2023-01-11 16:38:55.331481 |
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673854707660504 | infotest          | DATABASE | 2023-01-16 15:38:27.660436 |
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+----------+----------------------------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

3. Restore a table from the recycle bin in an appropriate way based on your business needs.

   * Restore a table from the recycle bin and keep the original name of the table.

      ```sql
      FLASHBACK TABLE object_name TO BEFORE DROP;
      ```

      `object_name` specifies the name of the table in the recycle bin or the original name of the table. The name in the recycle bin is globally unique. Therefore, we recommend that you use the name in the recycle bin.

      Example:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> FLASHBACK TABLE __recycle_$_100017_1673426335331800 TO BEFORE DROP;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

      The name of the restored table is the original name of the table before it is moved to the recycle bin. The database or schema to which the table belongs remains unchanged. If the original name of the table is the same as that of an existing table, the system returns an error.

   * Restore a table from the recycle bin and rename it.

      ```sql
      FLASHBACK TABLE object_name TO BEFORE DROP RENAME To new_table_name;
      ```

      `object_name` specifies the name of the table in the recycle bin or the original name of the table. The name in the recycle bin is globally unique. Therefore, we recommend that you use the name in the recycle bin. `new_table_name` specifies the new name of the table after it is restored from the recycle bin.

      Example:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> FLASHBACK TABLE __recycle_$_100017_1673426335331800 TO BEFORE DROP RENAME To infotable;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

      The name of the restored table is the new name of the table after it is restored. The database or schema to which the table belongs remains unchanged. If the new name of the table is the same as that of an existing table, the system returns an error.

   * Restore a table from the recycle bin to a specified database or schema and rename it.

      ```sql
      FLASHBACK TABLE object_name TO BEFORE DROP RENAME To database_name.new_table_name;
      ```

      `object_name` specifies the name of the table in the recycle bin or the original name of the table. The name in the recycle bin is globally unique. Therefore, we recommend that you use the name in the recycle bin. `database_name.new_table_name` specifies the new name of the table after it is restored from the recycle bin, as well as the name of the database to which the table belongs. Schema object names of Oracle user tenants are the same as usernames.

      Example:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> FLASHBACK TABLE __recycle_$_100017_1673426335331800 TO BEFORE DROP RENAME To test.infotable;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

      The name of the restored table is the new name of the table after it is restored. The database or schema to which the table belongs is the specified one. If the new name of the table is the same as that of an existing table, the system returns an error.
