# Login failure processing

If OceanBase Database is in Oracle mode, for users who have multiple failed logon attempts, the system will lock the user to prevent malicious password attacks, thereby improving database security.

The Oracle mode of OceanBase Database uses Profile to lock a user.

## Concepts

Profile is a means of limiting the resources available to a database user. In the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database, the profile is used to control a user's logon verification policy. By using a user's profile file, it is possible to lock the user. 

The profile file provides two parameters to lock the user after multiple consecutive logon failures:

* `failed_login_attempts`: the number of consecutive failed logon attempts. 
* `password_lock_time`: the lock time, in days. 

The lock and unlock policies are as follows:

* Lock policy: When there are repeated failed logon attempts due to an incorrect password, if the failure threshold is reached, the user will be locked out. 
* Unlock policy: If a logged-in user is locked out, when attempting to log in again, the system will check the lock time. If the lock time has expired, the system will unlock the user and the user attempts to log in again. If the lock time has not expired, the system will return an error. You can also use SQL statements to unlock the user. 

## Procedure

The administrator can process logon failures by creating a profile and applying it to users, which mainly includes the following two steps:

1. Create a profile. 

   Use the `CREATE PROFILE` statement to create a profile and specify the number of consecutive logon failures allowed for a user and the corresponding lock time. 

   ```sql
   CREATE PROFILE "profile_name" LIMIT 
     { FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS
       | PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME
       | PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME
       | PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME
       }
       { integer | UNLIMITED | DEFAULT };
   ```

   Notes:

   * Executing this statement requires the `CREATE PROFILE` permission. 

   * `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`: specifies the number of consecutive failed logon attempts. 

      If this parameter is not specified, the setting of the `DEFAULT` profile will be used. The value of this parameter in the `DEFAULT` profile is `UNLIMITED`, which indicates that there is no limit to the number of consecutive failed logon attempts. 

   * `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME`: specifies the number of days that a user is locked out after a threshold for consecutive logon failures has been reached. 

      If this parameter is not specified, the setting of the `DEFAULT` profile will be used. The value of this parameter in the `DEFAULT` profile is `UNLIMITED`, which indicates that there is no limit to the number of days a user will be locked out. 

   * `PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME`: specifies the number of days for which the same password can be used for authentication. 

      If this parameter is not specified, the setting of the `DEFAULT` profile will be used. The value of this parameter in the `DEFAULT` profile is `UNLIMITED`, which indicates that there is no limit to the number of days the same password can be used for authentication. 

   * `PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME`: After the `PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME` has been reached, the system issues a warning. This parameter is used to specify the number of days that users are allowed to log in after the warning has been issued.

      If this parameter is not specified, the setting of the `DEFAULT` profile will be used. The value of this parameter in the `DEFAULT` profile is `UNLIMITED`, which indicates that there is no limit to the number of days that a user can log in. 

   * `integer | UNLIMITED | DEFAULT` specifies the value range of a parameter.

      * `integer` indicates that the value of the parameter is an integer. 

      * `UNLIMITED` indicates that the value of the parameter is not restricted. 

      * `DEFAULT` indicates that the setting of the `DEFAULT` profile is used. 

   For more information about the `CREATE PROFILE` statement, see [CREATE PROFILE](../../../../7.reference/4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/3.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/9.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/1.ddl-of-oracle-mode/19.create-profile-of-oracle-mode.md). 

2. Apply the profile to a user. 

   There are two scenarios:

   * When creating a user, you can directly specify the profile file that has already been created. 

      The SQL statement is as follows:

      ```shell
      obclient> CREATE USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY password PROFILE
      {"profile_name" | default};
      ```

      If a profile is not specified when you create a user, the `DEFAULT` profile will be used. You can query the setting of the `DEFAULT` profile through  the system view `DBA_PROFILES`. 

      For more information about the `CREATE USER` statement, see [CREATE USER](../../../../7.reference/4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/3.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/9.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/1.ddl-of-oracle-mode/27.create-user-of-oracle-mode.md). 

   * If the user has already been created, you can apply an existing profile file to the user by modifying their profile. 

      The SQL statement is as follows:

      ```shell
      obclient> ALTER USER user_name PROFILE {"profile_name" | default};
      ```

      For more information about the `ALTER USER` statement, see [ALTER USER](../../../../7.reference/4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/3.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/9.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/1.ddl-of-oracle-mode/12.alter-user-of-oracle-mode.md). 

## Example

1. Log on to an Oracle tenant of a cluster using the SYS user.

   ```shell
   obclient -usys@oracle -h127.1 -P2881 -  P***1*** 
   ```

2. Create a profile and set up a policy for consecutive failed logons. 

   Create a profile named `userprof1` that locks the user out for one day after five consecutive failed logon attempts. 

   ```shell
   obclient> CREATE PROFILE "userprof1" LIMIT FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 5 
   PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME 1;
   ```

3. Execute the following statement to check whether the setting was successful: 

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT * FROM DBA_PROFILES;
   +-----------+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+
   | PROFILE   | RESOURCE_NAME            | RESOURCE_TYPE | LIMIT       |
   +-----------+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+
   | DEFAULT   | FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS    | PASSWORD      | UNLIMITED   |
   | DEFAULT   | PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME      | PASSWORD      | UNLIMITED   |
   | DEFAULT   | PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME       | PASSWORD      | UNLIMITED   |
   | DEFAULT   | PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME       | PASSWORD      | 86400000000 |
   | DEFAULT   | PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION | PASSWORD      | NULL        |
   | userprof1 | FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS    | PASSWORD      | 5           |
   | userprof1 | PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME      | PASSWORD      | DEFAULT     |
   | userprof1 | PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME       | PASSWORD      | DEFAULT     |
   | userprof1 | PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME       | PASSWORD      | 86400000000 |
   | userprof1 | PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION | PASSWORD      | DEFAULT     |
   +-----------+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+
   10 rows in set
   ```

4. Create a user and specify a profile. 

   ```shell
   obclient> CREATE USER secuser IDENTIFIED BY ***1** PROFILE "userprof1";
   
   obclient> GRANT all privileges ON *.* to secuser;
   ```

5. Verify the configuration result. 

   If five consecutive incorrect passwords are entered, the user will be locked for one day. 

   ```shell
   $ obclient -h127.1 -P2881 -usecuser@oracle -p**123**;
   obclient: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
   ERROR 5039 (01007): User locked
   ```

   Log on to the `sys` tenant using the `root` user and view information about failed logon attempts. 

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT * FROM information_schema.CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS;
   +-------------+-----------------+
   | USERHOST    | FAILED_ATTEMPTS |
   +-------------+-----------------+
   | 'test'@'%' |               5 |
   +-------------+-----------------+
   1 row in set (0.005 sec)
   ```

6. Unlock the user. 

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice:</h4>
    <p>The operation of unlocking a user is generally performed by the administrator. If an ordinary user needs to perform lock and unlock operations, they must have global <code>ALTER USER</code> privileges. For more information about how to view and grant user privileges, see <a href="../../../../6.manage/5.security-and-permissions/3.access-control/2.user-and-permission/3.permission-of-oracle-mode/6.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md">View user privileges</a> and <a href="../../../../6.manage/5.security-and-permissions/3.access-control/2.user-and-permission/3.permission-of-oracle-mode/7.modify-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md">Modify user privileges</a>.
    </main>

   ```shell
   obclient> ALTER USER secuser ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
   ```

## Modify the logon failure processing policy

Execute the `ALTER PROFILE` statement to modify an existing profile. 

For more information about the `ALTER PROFILE` statement, see [ALTER PROFILE](../../../../7.reference/4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/3.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/9.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/1.ddl-of-oracle-mode/4.alter-profile-of-oracle-mode.md).

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice:</h4>
    <p>For users who have already been locked out, it is not possible to unlock them by modifying <code>FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS</code> using the <code>ALTER PROFILE</code> statement. Changes made to a configuration file with the <code>ALTER PROFILE</code> statement only affect users in subsequent sessions, not those in the current session. </p>
