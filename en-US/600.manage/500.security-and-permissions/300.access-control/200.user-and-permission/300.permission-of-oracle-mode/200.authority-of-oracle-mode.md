# Direct privileges

User privileges are divided into direct and indirect privileges. Direct privileges are the system or object privileges that are granted to a user. Indirect privileges are those that are granted to roles of a user. Most operations can be performed with direct or indirect privileges. This topic describes how to grant direct privileges to users. 

Direct privileges are required to perform the following operations:

* When creating a view, the user needs permission to access objects in a view.
* Permissions required to execute statements in a named PL block with the definers' rights. 

## Prerequisites

* When granting an object privilege, the current user must be the owner of the object or have the privilege to be granted. For example, if `test1` grants the `SELECT` privilege on table `t1` to `test2`, then `test1` must have the `SELECT` privilege on table `t1`. In addition, the user must have the `GRANT OPTION` or `GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE` privilege. 

* When granting a system privilege or a role, the current user must have the privilege or role to be granted and have the `GRANT OPTION`, `GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE`, or `GRANT ANY ROLE` privilege. 

For more information about how to view privileges, see [View user privileges](../300.permission-of-oracle-mode/600.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If the user does not have the required privileges, contact the administrator to obtain the privileges. For more information about how to view roles, see [View roles](../../../../../700.reference/200.administrator-guide/200.basic-database-management/400.manage-tenants/900.manage-users-and-permissions/200.oracle-mode/900.manage-roles-of-oracle-mode/600.view-roles-of-oracle-mode.md). 

### Considerations

When granting privileges, pay attention to the following:

* When granting multiple privileges to a user at a time, separate the privileges with commas (,). 

* If a user has been granted a privilege, the privilege takes effect only after the user is reconnected to OceanBase Database. 

### Examples

* Grant system privileges

   Grant the `CREATE SEQUENCE` privilege to the `test` user. 

   ```shell
   obclient> GRANT CREATE SEQUENCE TO test;
   ```

* Grant object privileges

   Grant the `SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges on the `emp_view` view to the `test` user. 

   ```shell
   obclient> GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON emp_view TO test;
   ```

For more information about the `GRANT` statement, see [GRANT](../../../../../700.reference/400.development-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/300.dcl-of-oracle-mode/1700.grant-of-oracle-mode.md).
