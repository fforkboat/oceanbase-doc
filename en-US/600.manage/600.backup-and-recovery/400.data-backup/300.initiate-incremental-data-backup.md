# Initiate an incremental data backup job

An incremental data backup job backs up all macroblocks modified since the last full backup.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that full data backup has been performed. If not, initiate a full data backup job first. For more information, see [Initiate a full data backup job](2.initiate-full-data-backup.md).

## Initiate an incremental data backup job

After you complete the preparations, you can perform the following steps to initiate an incremental data backup job.

Assume that the current cluster contains three tenants: `sys`, `mysql_tenant`, and `oracle_tenant`.

### Initiate an incremental data backup job from the sys tenant

You can initiate an incremental data backup job for all tenants or a specified tenant in the cluster from the `sys` tenant.

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of a cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statement to initiate an incremental data backup job:

   * Initiate an incremental data backup job for all tenants in the cluster

      Execute the following statement to initiate an incremental data backup job for all tenants in the cluster.

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP INCREMENTAL DATABASE;
      ```

      After the statement is executed, the system initiates an incremental data backup job for the `mysql_tenant` and `oracle_tenant` tenants in the cluster.

   * Initiate an incremental data backup job for a specified tenant in the cluster

      You can initiate an incremental data backup job for a specified tenant without affecting other tenants in the cluster.

      To initiate an incremental data backup job for the `mysql_tenant` tenant, execute the following statement:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP INCREMENTAL TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

      <main id="notice" type='explain'>
         <h4>Note:</h4>
         <p>If you specify multiple tenants, separate the tenant names with commas (<code>,</code>). </p>
      </main>

      After the statement is executed, the system initiates an incremental data backup job for the `mysql_tenant` tenant.

   You can view the backup progress in real time. For more information, see [View the data backup progress](5.view-data-backup-progress.md).

### Initiate an incremental data backup job for a user tenant

You can initiate an incremental data backup job for a user tenant without affecting other tenants.

1. Log on to the database as a tenant administrator.

   In this example, you can log on to the `mysql_tenant` tenant as the `root` user, or to the `oracle_tenant` tenant as the `SYS` user.

2. Execute the following statement to initiate an incremental data backup job:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP INCREMENTAL DATABASE;
   ```

   After the statement is executed, the system initiates an incremental data backup job for the current tenant.

   You can view the backup progress in real time. For more information, see [View the data backup progress](5.view-data-backup-progress.md).
