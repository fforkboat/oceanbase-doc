# View data backup parameter settings

After you run a backup job, you can query the settings of backup parameters.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of a cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute specific statements to query the settings of backup parameters.

   * View the weight of thread time slices used by job queues with high reliability and a low or medium priority, such as backup job queues and backup cleanup job queues.

      Example:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE '%ha_low_thread_score%'\G
      *************************** 1. row ***************************
            zone: z1
        svr_type: observer
          svr_ip: xx.xx.xx.xx
        svr_port: 45774
            name: ha_low_thread_score
       data_type: NULL
           value: 0
            info: the current work thread score of high availability low thread. Range: [0,100] in integer. Especially, 0 means default value
         section: OBSERVER
           scope: TENANT
          source: DEFAULT
      edit_level: DYNAMIC_EFFECTIVE
      ```

      The `ha_low_thread_score` parameter specifies the weight of thread time slices used by low- or medium-priority job queues such as backup job queues and backup cleanup job queues. The default value is `2`. If a data backup job runs slowly, you can increase the value of the `ha_low_thread_score` parameter. We recommend that you double the value each time.

      To set the concurrency for writing data to the file system during backup, execute the following statement:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]>  ALTER SYSTEM SET ha_low_thread_score = 4 TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

      In this example, the `ha_low_thread_score` parameter is set to `4` to increase the proportion of thread time slices used by the queue where the backup job of the `mysql_tenant` tenant belongs.

   * View the backup paths of tenants.

      Example:

      ```shell
      obclient> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_PARAMETER\G
      *************************** 1. row ***************************
      TENANT_ID: 1002
           NAME: data_backup_dest
          VALUE: file:///data/nfs/backup/data
      ```

      The `oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_PARAMETER` view displays the backup paths of all tenants in the current cluster. In this example, the backup path specified by the `data_backup_dest` parameter for the tenant with the ID `1002` is `file:///data/nfs/backup/data`.
