# Perform physical restore

This topic describes how to perform tenant-level physical restore by using an SQL statement. OceanBase Database supports tenant-level full restore based on points in time.

After you execute the restore statement, the system restores the required macroblock data from the corresponding full and incremental backups at the backup destination to the destination tenant and then pulls and replays the transaction logs.

## Prerequisites

The preparations before the restore are complete. For more information, see [Preparations](1.preparation-before-recovery.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. (Optional) Execute the following statement to set a restore password for the backup.

   You need to set a restore password for the backup only if a password is added during data backup.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SET DECRYPTION IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
   ```

   In the statement, `password` must be replaced with the password added during data backup. If the password for full backup is different from the password for incremental backup, you must enter the password for full before the password for incremental backup and separate them with a comma.

   For example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SET DECRYPTION IDENTIFIED BY '******';

   obclient [(none)]> SET DECRYPTION IDENTIFIED BY '******','******';
   ```

3. Execute the following statement to start a restore job:


   * Restore to a specified timestamp

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE dest_tenant_name FROM uri UNTIL TIME=timestamp WITH restore_option [DESCRIPTION description];
      ```

   * Restore to a specified SCN

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE dest_tenant_name FROM uri UNTIL SCN=scn WITH restore_option [DESCRIPTION description];
      ```

   * Restore to the latest checkpoint

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE dest_tenant_name FROM uri WITH restore_option [DESCRIPTION description];
      ```


   * `uri` specifies the data backup path and log archive path, and `UNTIL [TIME|SCN]` specifies the end checkpoint for restore.

   * To restore to a specified `TIME` or `SCN`, you must join the parameter name and value with an equal sign (`=`).

   * In `restore_option`, you can specify `pool_list`, `locality`, `primary_zone`, and `kms_encrypt`. `pool_list` is required and the others are optional.

   For more information about `TIME`, `SCN`, and other parameters, see [Parameters related to physical restore](8.parameters-of-the-restore.md).

   Here are some examples:

   * NFS

      * Restore the `mysql` tenant from the data backup path `file:///data/nfs/backup/data` and log archive path `file:///data/nfs/backup/archive` to the specified timestamp `2020-06-01 00:00:00`, and set the resource pool to `restore_pool`.

         ```shell
         obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE mysql FROM 'file:///data/nfs/backup/data,file:///data/nfs/backup/archive' UNTIL TIME='2020-06-01 00:00:00' WITH 'pool_list=restore_pool';
         ```

      * Restore the `mysql` tenant from the data backup path `file:///data/nfs/backup/data` and log archive path `file:///data/nfs/backup/archive` to the latest archive checkpoint, and set the resource pool to `restore_pool`.

         ```shell
         obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE mysql FROM 'file:///data/nfs/backup/data,file:///data/nfs/backup/archive' WITH 'pool_list=restore_pool';
         ```

      * Restore the `mysql` tenant from the data backup path `file:///data/nfs/backup/data` and log archive path `file:///data/nfs/backup/archive` to the specified SCN `1658285759724047000`, and set the resource pool to `restore_pool`.

         ```shell
         obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE mysql FROM 'file:///data/nfs/backup/data,file:///data/nfs/backup/archive' UNTIL SCN=1658285759724047000 WITH 'pool_list=restore_pool';
         ```

      * Restore the `mysql` tenant from the data backup path `file:///data/nfs/backup/data` and log archive path `file:///data/nfs/backup/archive` to the specified timestamp `2020-06-01 00:00:00`. Set the resource pool to `restore_pool` and the locality of replicas to `F@z1,F@z2,F@z3`.

         ```shell
         obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE mysql FROM 'file:///data/nfs/backup/data,file:///data/nfs/backup/archive' UNTIL TIME='2020-06-01 00:00:00' WITH 'pool_list=restore_pool&locality=F@z1,F@z2,F@z3';
         ```

      * Restore the `mysql` tenant from the data backup path `file:///data/nfs/backup/data` and log archive path `file:///data/nfs/backup/archive` to the specified timestamp `2020-06-01 00:00:00`. Set the resource pool to `restore_pool`, the locality of replicas to `F@z1,F@z2,F@z3`, and `primary_zone` to `z1`.

         ```shell
         obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE mysql FROM 'file:///data/nfs/backup/data,file:///data/nfs/backup/archive' UNTIL TIME='2020-06-01 00:00:00' WITH 'pool_list=restore_pool&locality=F@z1,F@z2,F@z3&primary_zone=z1';
         ```

   * Object Storage Service (OSS)

      Except for the `url` parameter, the settings of other parameters are consistent with those when `NFS` is used.

      * Restore the `mysql` tenant from the OSS backup path `oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/data/?host=xxx.aliyun-inc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx` and OSS log archive path `oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/archive/?host=xxx.aliyun-inc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx` to the specified timestamp `2020-06-01 00:00:00`, and set the resource pool to `restore_pool`.

         ```shell
         obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE mysql FROM 'oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/data/?host=xxx.aliyun-inc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx,oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/archive/?host=xxx.aliyun-inc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx' UNTIL TIME='2020-06-01 00:00:00' WITH 'pool_list=restore_pool';
         ```

4. (Optional) After you create the meta tenant corresponding to the tenant to be restored, set the `ha_low_thread_score` parameter to specify the backend scheduling weight for the restore task to speed up the restore.

   1. Query the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS` view to check whether the meta tenant is created.


      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS;
      ```

      In the query results, tenant names starting with `META$` in the `TENANT_NAME` column indicate meta tenants. Meta tenants in the `TENANT_STATUS_NORMAL` state are successfully created.

      <!-- For more information about the fields in the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS` view, see [oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS](../../../7.reference/5.system-reference/4.system-overview-of-mysql-mode/2.dictionary-view-of-mysql-mode/58.oceanbase-dba_ob_tenants-of-mysql-mode.md). -->

   2. Specify the `ha_high_thread_score` parameter.

      The tenant-level `ha_high_thread_score` parameter specifies the current number of high-availability worker threads with a high priority. Default value: `0`. Value range: [0, 100]. We recommend that you set this parameter to `10`. For more information about the `ha_high_thread_score` parameter, see [ha_high_thread_score](../../../7.reference/5.system-reference/1.system-configuration-items/4.tenant-level-configuration-items/41.ha_high_thread_score.md).

      Sample statement:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM SET ha_high_thread_score =10 TENANT = mysql;
      ```

## What to do next

After you initiate a restore job, you can query the corresponding views to check the restore progress and results. For more information, see [Query the restore progress](4.view-the-restore-progress.md).

Physical restore is associated with Physical Standby Database. A physically restored tenant serves as a standby tenant. You can change its role to PRIMARY based on your business needs. For more information about how to proceed to log replay from the source tenant, see [Replay logs to a standby tenant](7.recover-the-standby-tenant.md). For more information about how to change the role of a standby tenant to PRIMARY, see [Change the role of a standby tenant to PRIMARY](6.active-standby-tenant.md).
