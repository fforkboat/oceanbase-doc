Introduction to OceanBase Database tenants 
===============================================================



OceanBase Database supports multitenancy. Tenants in OceanBase Database are similar to database instances of traditional databases. You can create databases under a tenant and create tables in the databases of tenants. 

By default, an OceanBase cluster has a MySQL tenant named **sys** to store the metadata of the cluster. The sys tenant is used for cluster management and is frequently accessed by O\&M engineers. We recommend that you do not create tables to store data in the sys tenant. All resources in an OceanBase cluster, except for the resources used by the sys tenant, are unallocated and reserved for the business tenants. You need to create a business tenant before using OceanBase. 

Tenants are usually created by O\&M engineers directly in the sys tenant. 
**Note**



A tenant is also known as an instance.
