Database objects in a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database 
=============================================================================



In a MySQL tenant, each database object belongs to only one database. The database name is not directly related to your username. The database that you can access depends on your permissions. Typically, you need to switch to the database to which the database object that you want to access belongs. Otherwise, you must append the database name before the database object. 

The following database objects are supported:

* Tables

  A table is the most basic unit of data storage within OceanBase Database. A table contains one or more rows of independent data records. Each row contains one or more columns, with each column representing a field of the record.

* Indexes or keys

  

* Views

  

* Stored subprograms

  Stored subprograms are procedures and functions stored in a database. They are available to client-side applications that access the database.
