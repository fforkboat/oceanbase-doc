About sample database TPCC 
===============================================



The installation script for the sample database can be located in an Oracle or MySQL tenant in OceanBase Database. For an Oracle tenant, you need to create a user and a schema, and then log on as that user to run the script. For a MySQL tenant, you need to create a database and enter the database to run the script. 

The script is divided into two parts:

* A file named "create_tables_mysql.sql", containing statements for creating tables and views. 

* A file named "init_data.sql", containing statements for initializing table data. 




The sample database is a TPC-C database. TPC-C is the benchmark published by the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC), which models order creation and order payment in commodity sales. TPC-C is an On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) system benchmark. 

The sample database is available at https://github.com/obpilot/ob-samples for free download.
