# ENABLE_OPT_TRACE

The `ENABLE_OPT_TRACE` procedure enables end-to-end tracing for the optimizer of the current session. After end-to-end tracing is enabled, all plan generation procedures in the current session, including the SQL plan generation procedures in PL, are traced. In addition, a trace folder is generated in the log directory of the SQL execution node.

## Syntax

```sql
DEFAULT_INENTIFIER  constant VARCHAR2(20) := '';
DEFAULT_LEVEL       constant INT := 1;

PROCEDURE ENABLE_OPT_TRACE(
    sql_id          IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT '',
    identifier      IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT DEFAULT_INENTIFIER,
    level           IN INT DEFAULT DEFAULT_LEVEL
);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| sql_id | The ID of the SQL statement to be traced. For example, if you need to run PL programs in the current test and want to trace specific SQL statements in PL functions, you can set the `sql_id` parameter. If `sql_id` is specified, only specific SQL statements are traced. If `sql_id` is not specified, all SQL statements are traced.  |
| identifier | The suffix to the trace file to facilitate file retrieval.  |
| level | The trace level. Valid values:<ul> <li> `0`: Default behaviors are recorded. </li> <li> `1`: The memory and time consumed by each module are additionally recorded. </li> <li> `2`: Each SQL statement for rewriting query blocks is additionally recorded, regardless of whether the query block is rewritten. </li></ul> <br> **Notice**: `level` is a database keyword and must be enclosed by using double quotation marks ("") for Oracle tenants and by using backticks (`) for MySQL tenants. |

## Examples
