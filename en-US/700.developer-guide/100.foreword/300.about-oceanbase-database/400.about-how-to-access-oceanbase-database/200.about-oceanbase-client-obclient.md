About OceanBase client OBClient 
====================================================



OceanBase Client (OBClient) is an interactive and batch processing tool. It must be installed separately. OBClient is a command-line user interface that acts as a client when it is connected to the database. 

When you run OBClient, you need to specify the connection information of the OceanBase tenant. For more information, see the Connect to an OceanBase tenant through OBClient topic. 

After OceanBase Database is connected, you can run some OBClient commands (including general MySQL commands) and SQL statements in OBClient to execute the following tasks:

* Calculate, store, and print query results

  

* Create database objects and check and modify object definitions

  

* Develop and run batch scripts

  

* Manage databases and modify parameters
