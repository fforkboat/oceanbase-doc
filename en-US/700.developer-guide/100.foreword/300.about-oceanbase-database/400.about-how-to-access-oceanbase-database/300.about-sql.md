About SQL 
==============================



Structured Query Language (SQL) is an advanced programming language based on "set theory and relational algebra". All programs and users can use SQL to access data in OceanBase Database. 

SQL is a declarative or nonprocedural language. This means SQL describes what to do, not how to do it. You specify the result set that you want (for example, the names of the employees), but do not specify how to get it. However, you can use SQL statements or SQL hints to optimize the execution plan of how an SQL statement retrieves data, to improve the SQL execution performance.
