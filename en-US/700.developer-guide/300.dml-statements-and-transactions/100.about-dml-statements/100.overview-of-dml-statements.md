Overview of DML statements 
===============================================



You can use a data manipulation language (DML) statement to add, update, and delete data in a table. 
**Note**



In the command line (CLI) environment of OceanBase Client (OBClient), you can enter a DML statement after the SQL prompt (\>).

A change made by a DML statement is persisted only when the transaction is committed. A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that OceanBase Database treats as a unit. Either all of the statements are executed, or none of them are. A DML statement can also be a transaction. A transaction can be rolled back before it is committed.
