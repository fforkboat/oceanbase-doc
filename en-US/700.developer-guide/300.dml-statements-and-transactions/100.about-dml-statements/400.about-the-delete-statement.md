About the DELETE statement 
===============================================



A DELETE statement is used to delete records from a table. 

Basic syntax for the DELETE statement:

```javascript
DELETE FROM table_name [ WHERE condition ];
```



The WHERE clause is optional. If you do not specify a WHERE clause, the entire table is deleted. If a table contains millions of records, a large transaction is generated, which may reduce the performance. We recommend that you specify the WHERE clause to delete data in batches or use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement. 

Example: Deleting data from a table 
--------------------------------------------

```javascript
delete from ordr where o_w_id=2;

delete from ordr;
```



In addition to the DELETE statement, the REPLACE INTO statement may also be used to delete data.
