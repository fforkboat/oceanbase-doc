Roll back a transaction 
============================================



A transaction rollback reverses all changes made in the transaction. You can roll back an entire uncommitted transaction or roll back a transaction to any of its savepoints. To roll back to a specific savepoint, you must use both the ROLLBACK and TO SAVEPOINT statements. 

If you roll back an entire transaction:

* The transaction ends.

  

* All changes made from the start of the transaction are discarded.

  

* All savepoints are cleared.

  

* All locks held by the transaction are released.

  




If you roll back a transaction to a savepoint:

* The transaction does not end.

  

* Changes made before the savepoint are retained but those made after it are discarded.

  

* All savepoints after the specific savepoint are cleared.

  

* All locks held by the transaction after the specific savepoint are released.
