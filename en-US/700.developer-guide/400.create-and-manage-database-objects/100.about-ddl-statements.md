About DDL statements 
=========================================



Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are used to create, update, and delete database objects. OceanBase Database issues an implicit COMMIT statement before and after a DDL statement. Therefore, DDL statements cannot be rolled back. 
**Note**



In the command line (CLI) environment of OceanBase Client (OBClient), you can enter a DDL statement after the SQL prompt (\>). 

You can also enter a DDL statement in the ODC SQL Editor window.

OceanBase DDL supports the following database objects:

* Tables, including constraints and indexes

  A table is the most basic unit of data storage. Tables contain data that all users can access. Each table contains one or more rows. Each row contains one or more columns.

* Views

  A view displays the results of a query on the table. You can use views in most cases where you can use tables. When the data you frequently access is distributed across multiple tables, a view is the best choice.

* User-defined functions

  

* Custom types
