Overview 
=============================



Partitioning is one of the most important features of OceanBase. It solves the capacity problems and performance problems during highly concurrent access to large tables. It splits a large table into smaller independent objects with the same structure. These smaller objects are called partitions. A regular table contains only one partition. This can be considered as a special case of partitioned tables. A partition can be deployed on only one node. Different partitions in a table can be distributed on different nodes.
