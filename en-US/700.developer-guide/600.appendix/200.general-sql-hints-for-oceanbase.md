General SQL hints for OceanBase 
====================================================



Syntax of an SQL hint:

```javascript
/*+ HINT_NAME */
```



Or

```javascript
/*+ HINT_NAME ( HINT_PARA )
```



To connect to OceanBase Database from OceanBase Client (OBClient) or a MySQL client, be sure to specify the -c parameter so that the hint takes effect after it is sent to OBServer.
