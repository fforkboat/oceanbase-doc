# Query the metrics of a session

This topic describes how to query the internal metrics of a specified client session in OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), such as the SQL response count and SQL response size.

## View the internal metrics of a specified client session

You can use the `SHOW PROXYSESSION STAT id [like 'xx']` statement to query the internal metrics of a specified session in ODP.

Parameters:

* In the statement, `id` can be replaced with `cs_id` or `connection_id`. These parameters are equivalent.

* `cs_id` indicates the `ID` of a client session in ODP. `CONNECTION_ID` indicates the `ID` of a client session in OceanBase Database. For more information about `CONNECTION_ID`, see [CONNECTION_ID](../../../../7.reference/4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/2.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/4.functions-of-mysql-mode/6.information-functions-of-mysql-mode/5.connection-id-of-mysql-mode.md).

* The like section supports fuzzy match. Supported wildcard characters are the percent sign (%) and the underscore (_).

Sample code:
