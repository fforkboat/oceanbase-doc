# Manage clusters

During routine O&M, you can restart, stop, delete, and upgrade a cluster.

## Prerequisites

* The target cluster can be managed in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

   If the cluster has not been added to OCP, contact the administrator to add the cluster to OCP. For more information, see the **Take over a cluster** topic in OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

* You have permissions of the **CLUSTER_MANAGER** role.

   If you do not have permissions of the role, contact the administrator to obtain the permissions. For more information, see the **Edit a user** topic in OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

## View cluster information

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

2. In the **Clusters** section, view the names, versions, deployment modes, and statuses of all clusters managed in OCP.

3. Click the name of the target cluster to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.

   You can view the OceanBase Database version, number of regions, CPU architecture, and number of servers of the cluster.

## Restart a cluster

You can restart one, several, or all zones in a cluster. Generally, you need to restart zones for parameter modifications to take effect.

### Requirements and impact

Make sure that the OceanBase cluster to be restarted is a multi-replica cluster and has three or more replicas. In this case, the OceanBase cluster is restarted in rolling mode, without interrupting the business.

If the OceanBase cluster has less than three replicas, the business will be interrupted during the restart. Proceed with caution.

### Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

2. In the **Clusters** list on the page, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. Click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner on the **Overview** page and select **Restart Cluster**.

4. Set **Restart Scope** to **All**, a zone, or several zones.

   * If you set **Restart Scope** to **All**, the system will restart the observer processes of all nodes in the cluster.

   * If you set **Restart Scope** to specific zones, the system will restart the observer processes of these zones.

5. Click **Restart**.

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the progress of the restart task.

   You can also view the progress of the restart task on the **System Management > Tasks** page.

   If the task status is **Completed**, and the specific zones in the **Zones** list on the **Overview** page are in **Running** state, the cluster is successfully restarted.

## Delete a cluster

You can delete an OceanBase cluster that is no longer in use in OCP.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the cluster that you want to delete and click its name.

3. In the upper-right corner of the **Overview** page, click the **More** icon, and then select **Delete Cluster**.

4. In the **Delete Cluster** dialog box, enter delete.

   <!-- ![delete](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/reference/cluster-management/delete-ob-cluster.png) -->

5. Click **Delete**.

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the progress of the deletion task or the cause of the failure.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed**, and the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page does not include the OceanBase cluster, the cluster is deleted.
