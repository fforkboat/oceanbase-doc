# Start or stop a zone

You can start or stop a zone by using an SQL statement.

You can start or stop a zone in a cluster to allow all physical servers in the zone to provide services externally or prevent them from providing services externally.

## Start or stop a zone by using an SQL statement

Sample statement:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM {START|STOP|FORCE STOP} ZONE zone_name;
```

Notes:

* This statement can be executed only in the `sys` tenant.

* `zone_name` specifies the name of the target zone. This statement starts or stops only one zone at a time.

* `STOP ZONE` and `FORCE STOP Zone`

   * The `STOP ZONE` statement actively stops a zone.

      When this statement is executed, the system checks whether the logs of data replicas in all partitions are synchronized and whether the majority of replicas are online. The statement succeeds only when both conditions are met.

   * The `FORCE STOP Zone` statement force stops a zone.

      When this statement is executed, the system does not check whether the logs of data replicas in all partitions are synchronized but only checks whether the majority of replicas are online. The statement succeeds if the majority of replicas are online.

Example:

* Start `zone1` in the cluster.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM START ZONE zone1;
   ```

* Stop `zone1` in the cluster.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM STOP ZONE zone1;
   ```

* Forcibly stop `zone1` in the cluster.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM FORCE STOP ZONE Zone1;
   ```
