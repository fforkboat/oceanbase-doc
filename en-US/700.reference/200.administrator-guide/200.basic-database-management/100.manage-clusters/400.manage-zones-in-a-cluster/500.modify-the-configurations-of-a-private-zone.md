# Modify the configurations of a zone

OceanBase Database provides an SQL statement for modifying the configurations of a zone, including the region and IDC to which the zone belongs.

Sample statement:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM {ALTER|CHANGE|MODIFY} ZONE zone_name SET [zone_option_list]

zone_option_list:
    zone_option [, zone_option ...]

zone_option:
    | region
    | idc
```

Notes:

* This statement can be executed only in the `sys` tenant.

* `ALTER|CHANGE|MODIFY` specifies the action to take. The `ALTER`, `CHANGE`, and `MODIFY` actions function in the same way. You can use any one of them to modify the region attribute of the zone.

* `zone_name` specifies the name of the target zone. This statement modifies only one zone at a time.

* `zone_option_list` specifies the to-be-modified attributes of the target zone. Multiple attributes must be separated with commas (,).

   The following attributes can be modified:

   * `region`: the name of the region where the zone is located. Default value: `default_region`.

   * `idc`: The name of the IDC where the zone is located. This parameter is left empty by default.

Example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM ALTER ZONE zone1 SET REGION='HANGZHOU',IDC='HZ1';
```
