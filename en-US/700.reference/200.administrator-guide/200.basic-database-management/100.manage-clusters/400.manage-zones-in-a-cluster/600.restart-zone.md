# Restart a zone

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to restart a zone on the graphic user interface (GUI).

## Prerequisites

* The target cluster can be managed in the current OCP cluster.

   If the cluster has not been added to OCP, contact the administrator to add the cluster to OCP. For more information, see the "**Take over a cluster**" topic in OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

* You have the privileges to manage the cluster.

   If you do not have the privileges to manage the cluster, contact the administrator to obtain the required privileges. For more information, see the "**Edit a user**" topic in OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

* The majority of replicas are online. Otherwise, the restart will fail.

## Considerations

If the zone to be restarted hosts the leader of a tenant, the business of the tenant may be suspended during the restart.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

2. In the **Clusters** list on the page, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the **Zones** list, find the target zone, and then click **Restart** in the **Actions** column.

   A dialog box appears, asking you to confirm the restart.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **Restart**.

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the progress of the restart task.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed**, and the status of the zone is **Running** in the **Zones** list on the **Overview** page, the zone is restarted.
