# View the status of a node

You can view the status of a node by using an SQL statement.

## Procedure

You can query the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_SERVERS` view for the status of a node.

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statement to go to the database named `oceanbase`:

   ```sql
   obclient> USE oceanbase
   ```

3. Execute the following statement to view the status of the node.

   In the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_SERVERS` view, the status of a node is identified by the `stop_time` and `status` fields.

   * When the value of `stop_time` is `NULL`, the node is in the `started` state. When the value of `stop_time` is not `NULL`, the node is in the `stopped` state. In this case, the value of `stop_time` is the timestamp when the node was stopped.

   * The value of `status` can be:

      * `active`: indicates that the node is operating properly.

      * `inactive`: indicates that the node is offline.

   Sample statement:

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT stop_time,status FROM DBA_OB_SERVERS;
   +-----------+--------+
   | stop_time | status |
   +-----------+--------+
   | NULL      | ACTIVE |
   +-----------+--------+
   1 row in set
   ```
