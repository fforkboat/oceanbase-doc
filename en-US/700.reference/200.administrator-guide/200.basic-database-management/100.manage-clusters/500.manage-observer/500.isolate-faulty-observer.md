# Isolate a failed node

You can isolate an OBServer node when it fails. This ensures that new read and write requests are not routed to the failed node.

When a node fails, you can isolate it to switch leaders on the failed node to another node, thus restoring the write service for users and log synchronization. After the cluster recovers, run the `STOP SERVER` command to stop the failed node and then restart it.

Sample statement for isolating a failed node:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM ISOLATE SERVER 'ip:port' [,'ip:port'...] [ZONE [=] 'zone']
```

This statement can be executed only in the `sys` tenant.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statement to isolate the failed OBServer node.

   Sample code:

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM ISOLATE SERVER '10.10.10.10:2882' ZONE='zone1';
   ```

   If the statement succeeds, the failed node is isolated. You can also find that the `status` field in the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_SERVERS` view remains `active`, but the `stop_time` field of the node is no longer `NULL`, indicating that the node is in the `stopped` state. The value of the `stop_time` field becomes the timestamp when the node was isolated.

   Sample statement for querying the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_SERVERS` view:

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_SERVERS\G
    *************************** 1. row ***************************
                  SVR_IP: xx.xx.xx.xx

   For more information about the fields in the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_SERVERS` view, see [DBA_OB_SERVERS](../../../../5.system-reference/4.system-overview-of-mysql-mode/2.dictionary-view-of-mysql-mode/50.oceanbase-dba_ob_servers-of-mysql-mode.md).

You can execute the `ALTER SYSTEM START SERVER '10.10.10.10:2882'` statement to cancel the isolation of a node.
