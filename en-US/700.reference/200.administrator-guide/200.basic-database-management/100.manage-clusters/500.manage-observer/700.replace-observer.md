# Replace a node

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to replace a specified node from a cluster. Generally, this operation is performed to replace a damaged node. The number of OBServer nodes in the cluster remains unchanged after the replacement. To replace an OBServer node, you must perform the Stop Server and Add Server operations, which can take a long time.

## Prerequisites

* Your OceanBase cluster can be managed in OCP.

   If your OceanBase cluster has not been added to OCP, add it to OCP by following the instructions in OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

* You have the privileges to manage the cluster.

   If you do not have the privileges to manage the cluster, contact the administrator to obtain the required privileges. For more information, see the "**Edit a user**" topic in OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. On the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster in the Clusters list and click the cluster name. The Cluster Details page appears.

3. In the **OBServers** list, click **Replace** in the **Actions** column of the OBserver node that you want to replace.
