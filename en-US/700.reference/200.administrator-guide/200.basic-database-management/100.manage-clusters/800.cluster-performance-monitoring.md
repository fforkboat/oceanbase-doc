# Monitor cluster performance

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows the administrator to view performance metrics of clusters in different dimensions.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the left-side navigation pane on the page that appears, click **Performance Monitoring**.

4. In the **Data Filtering** section, select filter conditions.

   The following table describes the filter conditions.

   | **Condition** | **Description** |
   |----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Select Time | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode.  Select a time range for the data that you want to query.  |
   | Auto Refresh | By default, auto-refresh is disabled. After auto-refresh is enabled, data is refreshed every 5s.  |
   | Zone | Select the zone that you want to view.  |

   * If **Auto Refresh** is disabled, after you specify the filter conditions, the system displays the performance monitoring data based on the specified values of Select Time and Stat Period.

   * If **Auto Refresh** is enabled, after you specify a statistical range, the system displays the real-time performance monitoring data in the specified statistical range.

5. You can respectively view the performance metrics of databases and hosts in the cluster on different tabs.

   * Click the **Database Performance** tab to view the database performance.

      To display other metrics, click **Select Metric** on the right side and select the metrics that you want to display. The system can display up to 10 metrics.

   * Click the **Host Performance** tab to view the host performance.
