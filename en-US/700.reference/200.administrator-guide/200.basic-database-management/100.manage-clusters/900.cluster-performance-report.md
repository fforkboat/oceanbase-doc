# Cluster performance report

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) can generate performance reports for OceanBase clusters. A cluster performance report provides you with information about the cluster load, performance, and SQL statements within a specified period. The report also helps you learn about the cluster running status and troubleshoot performance-related problems as soon as possible.

## Background

OCP can generate cluster performance reports. The Reports list on the Performance Reports page includes the following columns: **Report Name**, **Snapshot Start Point**, **Snapshot End Point**, **Created By**, **Generation Status**, **Generated At**, and Actions. The Actions column provides the **View Report** and **Download Report** options.

* You can sort the reports by **Snapshot Start Point, Snapshot End Point, and Generated At**.

* You can filter the reports by **Generation Status**.

## Generate a performance report

1. Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

2. Find the target cluster in the **Clusters** list and click the cluster name. The **Overview** page appears.

3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Performance Report**. The Performance Report page appears.

4. Click **Generate Performance Report** in the upper-right corner of the page that appears.

5. In the dialog box that appears, configure the following settings:

   <!-- ![07062023](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/9345265261/p292019.png) -->

   | Parameter | Description |
   |-------|---------------------------------------------|
   | Report Name | Required. The name of the report.  |
   | Snapshot Start Point | You can select only a point in time in the past 30 days. The available points in time are fixed and cannot be customized.  |
   | Snapshot End Point | You can select only a point in time within 24 hours after the time you specified for Snapshot Start Point. The available points in time are fixed and cannot be customized.  |

6. If the SQL monitoring data of a tenant is abnormal in the performance report, select the tenant from the **View OceanBase Tenant ASH Report** drop-down list to go to the **ASH Report** page of the tenant.

   <!-- ![09141847](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/4879591361/p326763.png) -->

7. Click **OK**. A report is generated for the performance between the snapshot start point and the snapshot end point. You can view the report in the Reports list and download it.

## View and download a report

OCP shows a list of performance reports generated in the last 90 days.

* To view a performance report, click **View** in the **Actions** column.

* To download a performance report in the `.html` format, click **Download** in the **Actions** column.

You can view the following information in a performance report:
