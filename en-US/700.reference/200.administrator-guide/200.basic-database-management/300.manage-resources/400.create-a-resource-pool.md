# Create a resource pool

When you create a tenant, if the current resource pool is occupied by another tenant, you need to create a new resource pool.

## Prerequisites

The resource units to be used have been created. For information about how to create a resource unit, see [Create a resource unit](../300.manage-resources/200.create-a-resource-unit.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statement to create a resource pool and specify resource configurations for it.

   Sample statement:

   ```sql
   CREATE RESOURCE POOL poolname
   UNIT [=] unitname,
   UNIT_NUM [=] unitnum,
   ZONE_LIST [=] ('zone' [, 'zone'...]);
   ```

   Parameters:

   * The `UNIT_NUM` parameter specifies the number of resource units contained in a zone in the cluster. The value must be smaller than or equal to the number of OBServer nodes in the zone.

   * The `ZONE_LIST` parameter specifies the zones that are allowed to use resources in the resource pool.

   Create a resource pool named `pool1` and specify resource configurations for it.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE RESOURCE POOL pool1 UNIT='unit1',UNIT_NUM=1,ZONE_LIST=('zone1','zone2','zone3');
   ```

## More information

After a resource pool is created, you can allocate it to a tenant or modify it based on your business needs.
