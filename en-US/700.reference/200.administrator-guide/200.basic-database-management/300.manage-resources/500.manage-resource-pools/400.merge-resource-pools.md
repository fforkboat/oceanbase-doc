# Merge resource pools

For ease of management, you can merge multiple resource pools with the same resource configurations under a tenant into one resource pool.

## Limitations

When you merge resource pools, note the following limitations:

* The `unit_num` settings of the resource pools to be merged must be the same.

* The resource configurations of the resource pools to be merged must be the same.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statement to merge the resource pools.

   Sample statement:

   ```sql
   ALTER RESOURCE POOL MERGE  ('pool_name'[, 'pool_name' ...]) INTO ('merge_pool_name')
   ```

   `pool_name` specifies the names of multiple resource pools to be merged. `merge_pool_name` specifies the name of the new resource pool after the merge.

   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>The resource pools can still be used by the tenant when they are being merged. They are merged into one resource pool only from the perspective of the management layer in which the Root Service is located, to facilitate unified maintenance. </p>
   </main>

   Example:

   ```shell
   obclient>ALTER RESOURCE POOL MERGE ('pool0','pool1','pool2') INTO ('pool3');
   ```
