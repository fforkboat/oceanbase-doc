# Delete a resource pool

OceanBase Database allows you to execute SQL statements to delete resource pools that are no longer required.

## Prerequisites

Before you delete a resource pool, make sure that the resource pool is not being used by any tenant. If the resource pool is being used by a tenant, remove it from the tenant before deleting it. For information about how to remove a resource pool from a tenant, see [Remove a resource pool from a tenant](6.remove-a-resource-pool-from-a-tenant.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statement to check whether the to-be-deleted resource pool `resource_pool1` is being used by a tenant:

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT tenant_id,name FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_RESOURCE_POOLS WHERE name='resource_pool1';
   +-----------+----------------+
   | tenant_id |        name    |
   +-----------+----------------+
   |      NULL | resource_pool1 |
   +-----------+----------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   The value of `tenant_id` is `NULL`, which indicates that the resource pool is not used by any tenant.

3. Execute the following statement to delete the resource pool:

   Sample statement:

   ```sql
   DROP RESOURCE POOL pool_name;
   ```

   Example:

   ```shell
   obclient> DROP RESOURCE POOL resource_pool1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

4. Execute the following statement to check whether the resource pool is deleted:

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_RESOURCE_POOLS;
   ```

   The query results do not have `resource_pool1` in the `name` column, which indicates that the resource pool is deleted.
