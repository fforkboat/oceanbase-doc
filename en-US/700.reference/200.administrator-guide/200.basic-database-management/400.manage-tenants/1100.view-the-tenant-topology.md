# View the topology of a tenant

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides the tenant topology feature. Based on the topology of a tenant, you can view the cluster, zone, and OBServer node where the tenant resides.

Log on to the console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** and click the name of the tenant that you want to view in the **Tenants** list to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Topology** to view details of the tenant topology.

The topology of a tenant consists of three layers:

* The first layer, which indicates the cluster.

* The second layer, which indicates the zones.

* The third layer, which indicates the OBServer nodes.

## Cluster

The cluster icon displays the name and status of the cluster to which the tenant belongs.

Click the More icon on the right of the cluster icon to view supported operations.

* Click **View Cluster** to display the cluster topology on a new page.

* Click **Modify Zone Priority of Tenant** to modify the zone priority in the dialog box that appears.

## Zone

A zone icon displays the name and status of the zone.

If a zone contains a tenant replica, the zone icon is displayed in purple with the initial of the replica type next to the tenant name. Otherwise, the zone icon is gray.

* When you move the pointer over a zone icon, a tooltip appears and displays the type of the replica and the number of units in the zone.

   * Click **Delete Replica**. In the dialog box that appears, click **Delete** to delete the replica.

A server icon displays the IP address, port number, and status of the server.

If a server hosts a resource unit of a tenant, the server icon is displayed in green. Otherwise, the server icon is gray.
