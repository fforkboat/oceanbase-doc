# Copy a tenant

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to copy the information of a specified tenant to create a tenant, without copying data in the original tenant.

## Prerequisites

You are granted the system administrator or OCP tenant administrator role or another role that has permissions to manage the cluster. Otherwise, request the administrator to grant you the required role. For more information, see the "**Edit a user**" topic in OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**.

3. In the **Tenants** list, find the tenant that you want to copy and click **Copy** in the **Actions** column.

4. On the **Copy Tenant** page, configure zone information and other basic information.

5. Click **Submit**.

   After you submit the configurations, the system creates a tenant based on the definition of the current tenant. The data in the current tenant is not copied.
