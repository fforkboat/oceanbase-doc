# sys tenant

This topic describes the users and their roles under the system (sys) tenant.

Users under the sys tenant include the cluster administrator and regular users.

## Cluster administrator

The OceanBase cluster administrator is automatically created when you install OceanBase Database. The administrator can install and upgrade databases in the corresponding clusters, create tenants, allocate resources, import and export data, and back up and restore data in the clusters.

The `sys` tenant has a built-in cluster administrator: the `root` user.

## Users

Users created by the cluster administrator of the sys tenant are regular users under the sys tenant. Regular users under a sys tenant can create tenants, allocate resources, and grant access privileges within the cluster.
