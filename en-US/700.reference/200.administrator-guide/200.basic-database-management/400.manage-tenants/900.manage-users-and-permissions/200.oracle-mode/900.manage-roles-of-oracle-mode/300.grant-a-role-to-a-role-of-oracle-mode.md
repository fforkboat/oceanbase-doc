# Assign a role to another role

After you create a role, you can assign the role to another role.

You can assign a role to any role other than itself. Circular role assignment is not supported.

## Assign a role by using an SQL statement

To assign a role to another role, you must have the role to be assigned, and the `ADMIN OPTION` or `GRANT ANY ROLE` privilege.

For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../4.view-the-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the required privilege, contact an administrator. For more information, see [Modify user privileges](../5.modify-user-permissions-for-oralce-tenant-of-oracle-mode.md). For more information about how to view your roles, see [View roles](../9.manage-roles-of-oracle-mode/).

Syntax for the SQL statement:

```sql
GRANT role_name1 TO role_name2 [WITH ADMID OPTION];
```

Notes:

* `role_name1`: the name of the role to be assigned to another role. When you assign multiple roles to a role at a time, separate role names with commas (,).

   You can assign a role to multiple roles at a time, or assign multiple roles to one or more roles at a time.

* `WITH ADMIN OPTION`: specifies that the assigned role can be assigned to other users, and role revocation does not extend to other users.

Example: assign the `role2` role to the `role1` role.

```sql
obclient> GRANT role2 TO role1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

For more information about the `GRANT` statement, see [GRANT](../../../../../../4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/3.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/9.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/3.dcl-of-oracle-mode/17.grant-of-oracle-mode.md).
