# Assign a role to a user

You can assign a role to a user in Oracle mode by using SQL statements or OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

## Assign a role by using SQL statements

To assign a role to a user, you must have a role and the `ADMIN OPTION` or `GRANT ANY ROLE` privilege.

For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../4.view-the-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the required privilege, contact an administrator. For more information, see [Modify user privileges](../5.modify-user-permissions-for-oralce-tenant-of-oracle-mode.md). For more information about how to view your roles, see [View roles](../9.manage-roles-of-oracle-mode/6.view-roles-of-oracle-mode.md).

Execute the following SQL statement to assign a role to a user:

```sql
GRANT role_name TO grantee_user [WITH ADMID OPTION];
```

Notes:

* `role_name`: the name of the role. When you assign multiple roles to a user at a time, separate role names with commas (,).

   You can assign a role to multiple users at a time, or assign multiple roles to one or more users at a time.

* `WITH ADMIN OPTION`: specifies that the assigned role can be assigned to other users, and role revocation does not extend to other users.

Example: assign the `role1` role to the `user2` user.

```sql
obclient> GRANT role1 TO user2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

For more information about the `GRANT` statement, see [GRANT](../../../../../../4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/3.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/9.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/3.dcl-of-oracle-mode/17.grant-of-oracle-mode.md).
