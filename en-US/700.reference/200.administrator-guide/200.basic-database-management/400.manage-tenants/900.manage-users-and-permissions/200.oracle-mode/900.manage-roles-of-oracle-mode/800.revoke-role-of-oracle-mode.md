# Revoke a role

You can revoke a role from a user or another role.

## Revoke a role by using SQL statements

You can use the `REVOKE` statement to revoke a role from a user or another role.

### Prerequisites

To revoke a role from a user, you must have the role to be revoked and the `GRANT OPTION` or `GRANT ANY ROLE` privilege.

For more information about how to view your roles, see [View roles](6.view-roles-of-oracle-mode.md).

### Considerations

If the `GRANT OPTION` privilege is not specified when a role is assigned to a user, the revocation of the role on the user does not extend to other users. If the `GRANT OPTION` privilege is specified when a role is assigned to a user, the revocation of the role on the user extends to other users.

### Examples

SQL statements for revoking a role:

* Revoke a role from a user

   ```sql
   obclient> REVOKE role_list FROM user_name;
   ```

* Revoke a role from another role

   ```sql
   obclient> REVOKE role_list FROM role_name;
   ```

When you revoke multiple roles from a user at a time, separate the roles with commas (,).

Examples:

```sql
obclient>  REVOKE role1 FROM test;
```

For more information about the `REVOKE` statement, see [REVOKE](../../../../../../4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/3.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/9.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/3.dcl-of-oracle-mode/29.revoke-of-oracle-mode.md).
