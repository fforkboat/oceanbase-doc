# Drop a role

You can drop custom roles but not default roles.

## Drop a role by using an SQL statement

You can use the `DROP ROLE` statement to drop a role that you no longer need. To drop a role, you must have the `DROP ANY ROLE` privilege and are granted the `WITH ADMIN OPTION` privilege of the role to be dropped.

For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../400.view-the-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the required privilege, contact an administrator. For more information, see [Modify user privileges](../500.modify-user-permissions-for-oralce-tenant-of-oracle-mode.md).

When you drop a role, the system revokes the role from all users and roles and then deletes the role from the database.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>Dropping a role does not affect user sessions in which the role is enabled. However, after the role is dropped, the role can no longer be enabled in new user sessions. </p>
</main>

Syntax for the SQL statement:

```sql
obclient> DROP ROLE role_name;
```

Examples:

```sql
obclient> DROP ROLE role1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
