# Change the password of a user

You can use the ALTER USER or SET PASSWORD statement to change the password of a user.

## Change the password of a user by using the ALTER USER statement

You can execute the `ALTER USER` statement to change the passwords of other users. To execute this statement, you must have the `UPDATE USER` privilege.

For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/400.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md). If you do not have the `UPDATE USER` privilege, contact an administrator. For more information, see [Modify user privileges](../../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/500.modify-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md).

SQL syntax:

```sql
obclient>ALTER USER username IDENTIFIED BY password;
```

Example: Change the password of `sqluser01` to `\*\*\****`.

```sql
obclient> ALTER USER sqluser01 IDENTIFIED BY ******;
```

For more information about the `ALTER USER` statement, see [ALTER USER](../../../../../400.development-reference/100.sql-syntax/200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/600.sql-statement-of-mysql-mode/1800.alter-user-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Change the password of a user by using the SET PASSWORD statement

You can execute the `SET PASSWORD` statement to change your password or the passwords of other users.

Syntax:

```sql
obclient> SET PASSWORD [FOR user] = PASSWORD('password');
```

Notes:

* If the `FOR user` clause is absent, this statement changes the password of the current user. Any logged-on user can change their password.

* If the `FOR user` clause is specified, this statement changes the password of the specified user. To change the password of a specified user, you must have the global `CREATE USER` privilege.
