# Lock and unlock a user

You can lock a user that does not need to access OceanBase Database. The locked user cannot log on to OceanBase Database. You can unlock the user as an administrator.

## Prerequisites

If you log on as the administrator, you can directly lock and unlock users. If you log on as a regular user, you must have the global `ALTER USER` privilege to lock and unlock users. For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../../../../../../6.manage/5.security-and-permissions/3.access-control/2.user-and-permission/2.permission-of-mysql-mode/4.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md). If you do not have the global [ALTER USER](../../../../../../6.manage/5.security-and-permissions/3.access-control/2.user-and-permission/2.permission-of-mysql-mode/5.modify-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md) privilege, request the administrator to grant you the privilege. For more information, see `Modify user privileges`.

## Procedure

1. Log on to a MySQL tenant of the cluster.

2. Execute the following statement to lock or unlock a user.

   Sample statement:

   ```sql
   ALTER USER user_name ACCOUNT LOCK | UNLOCK;
   ```

   Examples:

   * Lock a user

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER USER demo ACCOUNT LOCK;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected

      obclient -udemo@demo0_111 -P2881 -h10.10.10.1   -p******
      obclient: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
      ERROR 3118 (HY000): User locked
      ```

   * Unlock a user

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER USER demo ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

      obclient> obclient -udemo@demo0_111 -P2881 -h10.10.10.1   -p******
      Welcome to the OceanBase.  Commands end with ; or \g.
      Your OceanBase connection id is 3221583856
      Server version: OceanBase 4.0.0.0 (r100000172022101218-6ab80a3950710941946c004d805fcfded7a4aa2c) (Built Oct 12 2022 18:43:39)

      Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

      obclient>
      ```

3. After you lock or unlock a user, you can check the `is_locked` field in the `DBA_OB_USERS` view to verify the lock status of the user as the administrator.

   Sample code:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SELECT user_name,is_locked FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_USERS WHERE user_name='demo';
   +-----------+-----------+
   | user_name | is_locked |
   +-----------+-----------+
   | demo      | NO        |
   +-----------+-----------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   If the value of the `is_locked` field is `YES`, the user is locked. If the value of the `is_locked` field is `NO`, the user is unlocked.
