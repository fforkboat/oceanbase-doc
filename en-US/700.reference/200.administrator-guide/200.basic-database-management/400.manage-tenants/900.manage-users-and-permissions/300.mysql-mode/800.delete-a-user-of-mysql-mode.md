# Drop a user

You can drop a user by using the `DROP USER` statement.

## Prerequisites

To execute the `DROP USER` statement, you must have the global `CREATE USER` privilege. For more information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/400.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md). If you do not have the required privilege, contact an administrator. For more information, see [Modify user privileges](../../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/500.modify-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Limitations

You cannot use the `DELETE` statement to delete user privileges from the `mysql.user` table.

## Procedure

1. Log on to a MySQL tenant of the cluster.

2. Execute the following statement to drop one or more users.

   Sample statement:

   ```sql
   DROP USER user_name [, user_name...];
   ```

   `user_name` specifies the username for the user to be dropped. To drop multiple users, separate their usernames with commas (,).

   After you drop a user, the database objects created by the user are not dropped. However, all privileges of the user are dropped.

   Example: Drop the `sqluser02` user.

   ```shell
   obclient> DROP USER sqluser02;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```
