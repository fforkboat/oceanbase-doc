# Manually initiate a minor compaction

You can execute the `ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE` statement in the `sys` tenant to manually initiate a minor compaction at the tenant, zone, server, log stream, or tablet level.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Select a proper minor compaction type as needed.

   * Minor compaction at the tenant level

      You can initiate a minor compaction for all tenants or for one or more specified tenants by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT [=] ALL | tenant_name [, tenant_name ...];
      ```

      Sample statement:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT =ALL;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected

      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE tenant = tenant1;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected

      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT =tenant1,tenant2;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

      <main id="notice" type='explain'>
       <h4>Note</h4>
       <p>If you execute the <code>ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE</code> statement without specifying a tenant, a minor compaction is initiated for the <code>sys</code> tenant. </p>
      </main>

   * Minor compaction at the zone level

      You can initiate a minor compaction for one or more specified zones by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE ZONE [=] zone_name [, zone_name ...];
      ```

      Sample statement:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE ZONE = zone1;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

   * Minor compaction at the server level

      You can initiate a minor compaction for one or more specified OBServer nodes by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE SERVER = ('ip:port' [, 'ip:port'...]);
      ```

      Sample statement:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE SERVER = ('xx.xx.xx.xx:2882');
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

   * Minor compaction at the log stream level

      You can initiate a minor compaction for a specified log stream of a specified tenant by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT [=] tenant_name LS [=] ls_id;
      ```

      In the syntax, `tenant_name` specifies the name of a tenant and `ls_id` specifies the ID of a log stream in the tenant. You can query the `oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLET_TO_LS` view for IDs of log streams.

      Sample statement:

      ```shell
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT = t1 LS = 1001;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

      After you execute this statement, the system performs a minor compaction for all tablets in the specified log stream of the specified tenant.

   * Minor compaction at the tablet level

      You can initiate a minor compaction for a specified tablet in a specified tenant by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT [=] tenant_name TABLET_ID = tid;
      ```

      Alternatively, you can initiate a minor compaction for a specified tablet in a specified log stream of a specified tenant by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT [=] tenant_name LS [=] ls_id TABLET_ID = tid;
      ```

      In the syntax, `tenant_name` specifies the name of a tenant, `ls_id` specifies the ID of a log stream in the tenant, and `tid` specifies the ID of a tablet in the log stream. You can query the `oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLET_TO_LS` view for the IDs of log streams and tablets.

      Sample statement:

      ```shell
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT = t1 tablet_id = 200001;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected

      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT = t1 LS = 1001 tablet_id = 200001;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```
