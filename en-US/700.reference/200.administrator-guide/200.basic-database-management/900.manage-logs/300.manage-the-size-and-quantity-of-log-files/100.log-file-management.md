# Use the log file splitting feature

In OceanBase Database, a single log file cannot exceed 256 MB in size. You can use the log file splitting feature to manage the size of each log file.

For `observer.log`, `election.log`, `rootservice.log`, `observer.log.wf`, `election.log.wf`, and `rootservice.log.wf` files, if the size exceeds 256 MB, the file is split based on the following rules:

* The original log file is resized to 256 MB and is renamed in the format of `original log file name.yyyyMMddHHmmss`. `yyyyMMddHHmmss` indicates the time when the last log in this log file was generated.

* A new log file with the same name as the original log file name is created. Newly generated logs are contained in the new log file.

For example, if the `observer.log` file exceeds 256 MB in size, the original log file is renamed in the format of `observer.log.yyyyMMddHHmmss`, with a size of 256 MB. In addition, a new log file named `observer.log` is created. Sample code:

```shell
[admin@OceanBase000000000.sqa.ztt /home/admin/oceanbase/log]
$ls -alh | egrep '[0-9]{14}' | grep observer | grep -v wf
-rw-r--r-- 1 admin admin 256M Jul  7 05:34 observer.log.20160707053424
-rw-r--r-- 1 admin admin 256M Jul  7 05:38 observer.log.20160707053821

[admin@OceanBase000000000.sqa.ztt /home/admin/oceanbase/log]
$ls -alh | egrep '[0-9]{14}' | grep observer | grep wf
-rw-r--r-- 1 admin admin 256M Jul  7 02:09 observer.log.wf.20160707020914
-rw-r--r-- 1 admin admin 256M Jul  7 05:34 observer.log.wf.20160707053431
```
