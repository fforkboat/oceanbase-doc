# Drop a database

This topic describes how to drop a database in MySQL mode by using an SQL statement.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the `DROP` privilege. For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../../../../../6.manage/5.security-and-permissions/3.access-control/2.user-and-permission/2.permission-of-mysql-mode/4.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md). To acquire the `DROP` privilege, contact the administrator. For more information about how to grant privileges to a user, see [Modify user privileges](../../../../../6.manage/5.security-and-permissions/3.access-control/2.user-and-permission/2.permission-of-mysql-mode/5.modify-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the MySQL tenant of the cluster.

2. Use the `DROP DATABASE` statement to drop a database.

   Example:

   ```shell
   obclient> DROP DATABASE my_db;    
   ```

## What to do next

If the recycle bin feature is enabled, a database dropped by mistake can be restored from the recycle bin. For more information, see [Restore objects from the recycle bin](../../../../../6.manage/4.high-availability/5.recyclebin-management/4.restore-the-recyclebin-objects.md).
