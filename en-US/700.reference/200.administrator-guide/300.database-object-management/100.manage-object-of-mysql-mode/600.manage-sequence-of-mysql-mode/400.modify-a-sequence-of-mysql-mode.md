# Modify a sequence

After you create a sequence, you can use the `ALTER SEQUENCE` statement to modify the attributes of the sequence. OceanBase Database allows you to modify the minimum value, maximum value, increment step, and cycling flag of a sequence. You cannot modify the start value of a sequence. 

SQL syntax for modifying a sequence:

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE [database_name.]sequence_name
[MINVALUE int_value | NOMINVALUE]
[MAXVALUE int_value | NOMAXVALUE]
[INCREMENT BY int_value]
[CACHE int_value | NOCACHE]
[ORDER | NOORDER]
[CYCLE | NOCYCLE];
```

To execute this statement, you must have the `ALTER` privilege. 

Example: Modify the maximum value of the `seq2` sequence and enable cyclic generation of sequence values. 

```sql
obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq2 MAXVALUE 1024 CYCLE;
```

OceanBase Database also allows you to reset sequence values by adding the `RESTART` option. Examples:

* If the value of `INCREMENT BY` is greater than `0`, you can reset the sequence to make the sequence start from `MINVALUE`. If the value of `INCREMENT BY` is less than `0`, you can execute the following statement to reset the sequence to make the sequence start from `MAXVALUE`:

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq3 RESTART;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

* Execute the following statement to reset the sequence and make the sequence start from `3`:

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq4 RESTART START WITH 3;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

In the sequence value reset statement, `RESTART` is not necessarily placed after the sequence name. It can be placed anywhere in the statement, as shown in the following example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq4 START WITH 3 RESTART MINVALUE -100 CYCLE;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
