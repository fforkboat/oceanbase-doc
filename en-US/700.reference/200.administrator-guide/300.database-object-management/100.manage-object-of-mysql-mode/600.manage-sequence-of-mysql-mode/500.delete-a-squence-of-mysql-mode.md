# Drop a sequence

You can use the `DROP SEQUENCE` statement to drop a sequence. 

SQL syntax for dropping a sequence:

```sql
DROP SEQUENCE [IF EXISTS] [database_name.]sequence_name;
```

Notes:

* To execute this statement, you must have the `DROP` privilege. 

* If you specify `IF EXISTS` in the statement, no error is reported even if the sequence to be dropped does not exist. Otherwise, the system reports an error. 

* `database_name.` specifies the database in which the sequence resides. If you do not specify `database_name`, the system takes by default that the sequence is in the current logon database. 

Example: Drop a sequence named `S1`.

```sql
obclient> DROP SEQUENCE S1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
