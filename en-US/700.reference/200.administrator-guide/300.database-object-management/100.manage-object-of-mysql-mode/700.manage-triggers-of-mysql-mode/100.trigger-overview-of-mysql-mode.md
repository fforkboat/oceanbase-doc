# Overview

OceanBase Database in MySQL mode is compatible with the triggers of MySQL 5.6. Triggers are database objects that are related to tables. A trigger fires when a particular event occurs on a table.

To be specific, a trigger fires when a row is inserted into, updated in, or deleted from an associated table by using a statement. For example, you can insert rows by using the `INSERT` or `LOAD DATA` statement. The `INSERT` trigger fires each time a row is inserted. If you insert two rows at the same time, the trigger fires twice.

You can specify whether a trigger fires before or after a triggering event. For example, you can specify that a trigger fires before a row is inserted into a table or after a row in the table is updated.

OceanBase Database in MySQL mode supports the following types of triggers:

* `INSERT`: A trigger of this type fires when you insert a row by using an `INSERT`, `LOAD DATA`, or `REPLACE` statement.

* `UPDATE`: A trigger of this type fires when you update a row by using an `UPDATE` statement.

* `DELETE`: A trigger of this type fires when you delete a row by using a `DELETE` or `REPLACE` statement.

The `INSERT INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` statement is a special case in which a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger fires for each row, followed by an `AFTER INSERT` trigger or both the `BEFORE UPDATE` and `AFTER UPDATE` triggers, based on whether the row has a duplicate key.
