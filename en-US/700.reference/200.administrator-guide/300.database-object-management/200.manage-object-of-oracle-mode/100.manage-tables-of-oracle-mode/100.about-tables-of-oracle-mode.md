# Overview

Table is the most basic data storage unit in OceanBase Database. A table contains specific data that a user can access. A table consists of rows, and a row consists of columns.

Before you create and use tables, you can plan the tables by following these principles:

* Use tables based on the standard procedure and use reasonable table schemas to minimize data redundancy.

* Select a suitable SQL data type for each column.

   For more information about the SQL data types, see [Data types](../../../../4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/3.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/3.basic-elements-of-oracle-mode/2.data-type-comparison-rules-of-oracle-mode/1.overview-of-data-type-comparison-rules-of-oracle-mode.md).

* Choose a suitable table type based on your needs. OceanBase Database supports partitioned and non-partitioned tables.
