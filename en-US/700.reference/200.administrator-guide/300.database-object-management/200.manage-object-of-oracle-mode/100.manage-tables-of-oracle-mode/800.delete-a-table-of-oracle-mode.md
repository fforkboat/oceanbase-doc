# Drop a table

If you no longer need a table, you can use the `DROP TABLE` statement to drop it.

Example:

```sql
obclient> DROP TABLE test;
```

For the `DROP TABLE` statement:

* If the recycle bin is disabled within a tenant, a `DROP TABLE` operation directly drops the specified table. You can set the `recyclebin` parameter to enable or disable the recycle bin. By default, the recycle bin is disabled.

* If the recycle bin is enabled, a `DROP TABLE` operation moves the specified table to the recycle bin. Tables in the recycle bin can be permanently deleted or restored. For more information about the recycle bin, see [Restore objects from the recycle bin](../../../../../6.manage/4.high-availability/5.recyclebin-management/4.restore-the-recyclebin-objects.md).
