# Overview

The monitoring feature of OceanBase Database is dependent on the monitoring feature of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). OCP supports 24/7 monitoring and collection of metrics such as the performance, capacity, and running status for clusters, tenants, and nodes and displays the metrics in graphics and tables, to help you fully understand the status of OceanBase clusters, promptly identify cluster exceptions, and promptly receive alerts, ensuring the stable and efficient operation of databases.

## Monitoring

The monitoring feature of OceanBase Database covers the following aspects:

* Cluster status monitoring: Displays the health status, overall performance trends, top N clusters ranked by elapsed time of major compaction, maintenance tasks, inspection data, and server usage of OceanBase clusters on OCP.

* Cluster performance monitoring: Displays the historical and real-time monitoring data of performance metrics such as the resource status and QTPS of OceanBase clusters.

* SQL monitoring: Displays the monitoring data of metrics such as TOP SQL, SLOW SQL, RPC, events, and locks.

## Alert

The alert feature of OceanBase Database is dependent on the alert feature on OCP. When an alert event occurs, alert messages are sent to subscribers through the configured alert notification channels. The alert feature provided by OceanBase Database covers alert configuration, alert subscription, alert message management, and general alert item configuration.
