# Status monitoring

The **Clusters and Overview** pages in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) show the status monitoring information of OceanBase clusters.

## Prerequisites

Before you log on, make sure that you have read-only permissions or management permissions on the cluster. Otherwise, you cannot view the overview data of the cluster. For more information about permissions, see the "**Default OCP roles**" topic in OCP User Guide. For more information, see the "**Create a user**" topic in OCP User Guide.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

   The **Clusters** page displays the general information about clusters of the user in the following sections: **Top 5 Clusters by QPS**, **Top 5 Clusters by Elapsed Time of Major Compaction**, **Server Resources**, **Resource Usage**, and **Clusters**.

3. View the overview of clusters.

   * Top 5 Clusters by QPS

      Displays the top 5 clusters sorted by a specified performance metric in descending order in a specified time range. You can specify the performance metric and the time range as needed. You can click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner to zoom in the chart for a better view.

      <!-- ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/2965260261/p264657.png) -->

      The available performance metrics are **QPS (times/s)**, **Query Response Time (us)**, **Active Sessions**, and **CPU Utilization (%)**.

      | Metric | Description |
      |-------------|--------------------------------------|
      | QPS (times/s) | The number of SQL statements processed per second in OceanBase clusters managed by the current OCP cluster.  |
      | Query Response Time (us) | The average query response time of the cluster, in microseconds (us).  |
      | Active Sessions | The total number of active sessions in the selected time range.  |
      | CPU Utilization (%) | The average CPU utilization of the cluster.  |

      The following time ranges are available: **Last 1 Hour**, **Last 24 Hours**, and **Last 7 Days**.

   * Top 5 Clusters by Elapsed Time of Major Compaction

      Displays a bar chart of five clusters with the longest major compaction time in the last three days. A major compaction merges all dynamic and static data, which is time-consuming. When the incremental data generated in minor compactions reaches the specified threshold, OceanBase Database performs a major compaction on data of the same major version.

      This section is empty if no major compaction has been performed in the last three days. You can click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner to zoom in the chart for a better view.

   * Server Resources

      Displays information about each IDC, including the IDC name, total number of servers, and number of servers where OBServer nodes are deployed. You can determine whether it is necessary to perform a cluster scale-out based on such information.

      <!-- ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/2965260261/p264760.png) -->

   * Resource Usage

      Displays resource usage information of each cluster, including the cluster name, number of tenants, allocated CPU resources in percentage, allocated memory in percentage, and occupied disk space. You can sort clusters by the allocated CPU resources, allocated memory, and occupied disk space.

      <!-- ![07021646](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/6765745261/p291083.png) -->

      Click a cluster name to view details of the cluster on the displayed page. For more information, see OCP User Guide.

   * Clusters

      Displays the **Cluster Name**, **ID**, **OceanBase Version**, **Deployment Mode**, **Status**, **Created At**, and **Alert Information** of each cluster.

      Click a cluster name to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.  The **Overview** page displays the basic information of the cluster in the following fields: **Resource Usage**, **Alert Overview**, **System Events in Last 7 Days**, **Zones**, and **OBServers**.

      * **View the basic information**

         On the **Overview** page, you can view the basic information of the cluster in the following fields: **OceanBase Version**, **Regions**, **Deployment Mode**, **CPU Architecture**, **Servers**, **Tenants**, **Created By**, **OBProxy Cluster**, **Software Installation Path**, **Data Disk Path**, **Log Disk Path**, and **ConfigUrl**.

        <main id="notice" type='explain'>
        <h4>Note</h4>
        <p>If you have not associated the cluster with an OBProxy cluster, click Associate OBProxy Cluster to associate it with an OBProxy cluster. </p>
        </main>

        | Parameter | Description |
        |------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | OceanBase Version | The OceanBase Database version of the cluster.  |
        | Regions | The number of regions in the cluster.  |
        | Deployment Mode | The deployment mode of the cluster.  The value **1** indicates that the cluster has one zone and the zone has one host.  The value **1-1** indicates that the cluster has two zones, and each zone has one host.  The value **N-N-...N** (M Ns) indicates that the cluster has M zones and each zone has N hosts. |
        | CPU Architecture | When you add a host, OCP automatically identifies its hardware architecture. The primary cluster and standby clusters must have the same hardware architecture.  |
        | Servers | The number of hosts in the cluster. |
        | Tenants | The number of tenants in the cluster.  |
        | Created By | The username of the user who created the cluster.  |
        | OBProxy Cluster | Displays the OBProxy cluster that is associated with the current OceanBase cluster.  <ul><li>If the cluster is not associated with an OBProxy cluster, click **Associate OBProxy Cluster** to associate it with one or more OBProxy clusters. </li>   <li>If the cluster is associated with OBProxy clusters, you can click the edit icon to add or delete OBProxy clusters. </li></ul> |
        | Software Installation Path | The path specified when the cluster was created.  |
        | Data Disk Path | The path specified when the cluster was created.  |
