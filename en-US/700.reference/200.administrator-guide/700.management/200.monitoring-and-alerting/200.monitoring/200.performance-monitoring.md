# Performance monitoring

You can view the historical performance monitoring information of clusters in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

## Performance monitoring for all clusters

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

   On the **Clusters** page, you can view the information about the top 5 clusters sorted by a performance metric. You can specify a performance metric and a time range to view the top 5 clusters sorted by the specified performance metric in descending order.

   You can specify a performance metric and a time range to view the information about the top 5 clusters sorted by the specified performance metric. You can click the More icon in the upper-right corner to zoom in the chart for a better view.

   <!-- ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/2965260261/p264657.png) -->

   The available performance metrics are **QPS (times/s)**, **Query Response Time (us)**, **Active Sessions**, and **CPU Utilization (%)**.

   | Metric | Description |
   |-------------|--------------------------------------|
   | QPS (times/s) | The number of SQL statements processed per second in OceanBase clusters managed by the current OCP cluster.  |
   | Query Response Time (us) | The average query response time of the cluster, in microseconds (us).  |
   | Active Sessions | The total number of active sessions in the selected time range.  |
   | CPU Utilization (%) | The average CPU utilization of the cluster.  |

   The following time ranges are available: **Last 1 Hour**, **Last 24 Hours**, and **Last 7 Days**.

   | Transaction response time | The average time consumed by the server to process a transaction, in microseconds (us). | `v$sysstat` |
   | Active sessions | The number of active sessions. | `GV$OB_PROCESSLIST` |
   | Event waiting_count | The number of wait events per second. | `v$system_event` |
   | Event waiting_time | The average time of a wait event, in microseconds (us). | `v$system_event` |
   | Capacity_tables | The number of tables. | `CDB_TABLES` |

## Performance monitoring for a specific cluster

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the left-side navigation pane on the page that appears, click **Performance Monitoring**.

4. In the **Data Filtering** area, you can specify the following parameters to filter performance information:

   * **Select Time**: This parameter is not displayed in auto refresh mode.  Select a time range for the data that you want to query.

   * **Auto Refresh**: By default, the auto refresh mode is disabled. After it is enabled, performance monitoring data is refreshed every 5 seconds.

   * **Zone**: Select zones to view their performance monitoring data.

   * **OBServer**: Select OBServer nodes to view their performance monitoring data.

5. You can respectively view the performance data of databases and hosts in the cluster on different tabs.

   To display other metrics, click **Select Metric** on the right side and select the desired metrics in the **Select Metric** panel. The system can display up to 10 metrics.

   For more information about database performance metrics and host performance metrics, see the "**Monitoring metrics**" topic in OCP User Guide of the corresponding version.

## Tenant performance monitoring information of a specific cluster

You can view the performance information of the five tenants with the highest workload in a cluster.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Tenant Management**.

4. In the **Top 5 Tenants** area on the **Tenant Management** page, you can view the top 5 tenants sorted by performance metrics such as TPS, QPS, SQL response time, transaction response time, event waiting_number of times, event waiting_time, capacity_number of tables, and number of sessions.

   You can view the monitoring information for the last 1 hour, the last 24 hours, or the last 7 days.
