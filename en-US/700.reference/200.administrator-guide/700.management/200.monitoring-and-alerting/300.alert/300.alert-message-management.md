# Perform alert management

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to perform alert management. To be specific, you can manage alert events and block alerts.

* **Alert event management**: When an exception occurs in a cluster, you may receive a large number of alert notifications. In this case, if you want to view specific alert notifications and perform statistical analysis on specific alert notifications, you can manage alert events as needed.

* **Alert blocking**: A bug that causes exception alerts may require a long time to be fixed. To prevent frequent interruptions by these alerts, you can go to the **Alert Blocking** tab to block these alerts for a specific period of time.

## View alert events

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Alerts**.

3. Click the **Alert Events** tab.

4. Specify search criteria in the search area. All alert events that match the search criteria will be displayed in the **Alert Events** list.

   * You can search for alert events by alert status, alert level, start time, end time, keyword, application, and alert scope. Exact match is supported.

   * You can click **Export Alert Event** to export all alert events that match the search criteria to your computer.

   * If alert pushes are configured for the alert event, you can click **Failed** in the **Message Push** column to view details about the alert event.

   * If alert push is not configured for the alert event, you can click **Message Push Not Configured** in the **Message Push** column to configure alert push for the alert event.

5. Click the description in the **Alert Description** column of an alert event. The **Details** page of the alert event appears.

   You can view the information and notification history related to the alert on the **Details** page.

   <!-- ![05121002](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/403-cn/%E5%91%8A%E8%AD%A6%E8%AF%A6%E6%83%85.png) -->

6. On the details page of the alert event, click **Alert Blocking** in the upper-right corner to block alert messages.

   Then, the alert will not be reported before the block period expires.

7. When many alert events are received, you can clear alert messages as needed.

   1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Parameter Management**.

   2. Search for the `ocp.alarm.notification.expired-days` parameter in the parameter list to set the retention period of alert messages, in days.

      After you specify this parameter, the alert messages and alert events that exceed the retention period will be deleted. The following data will be deleted upon expiration:

      * ocp2_alarm_notification

      * ocp_alarm_event_notification

      * ocp2_alarm_event_history

      * ocp_alarm_event_record

      * ocp2_alarm_filter (Cleared data will be written to the `ocp2_alarm_filter_history` table. The amount of rule information is small and therefore the rule history table does not need to be cleared.)

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <ul>
   <li>We recommend that you set the alert clearing period to a proper value, for example, several months. </li>
   <li>Alerts must not be left uncleared and unhandled for a long time. You can configure alert message push. We recommend that you promptly handle received alert messages. </li>
   </ul>
   </main>

## Alert blocking

You can quickly block alerts on the **Alert Events** tab. However, this method blocks only reported alerts for a specified period of time, which is not flexible.

This section describes how to create a blocking condition. It is a more flexible method that allows you to block alerts before they are generated. After a blocking condition is created, the system starts to block alerts based on the condition. If the blocking condition does not take effect immediately, wait for another 30 seconds.

When you run an O&M task on an OceanBase cluster, alerts are automatically blocked.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Alerts**.

3. On the **Alert Blocking** tab, click **Create Blocking Condition**.

4. Configure the blocking condition in the **Create Blocking Condition** dialog box.

   | Field | Description |
   |--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Application | The alert source. Options include **OceanBase**, **OBProxy**, **OCP**, **OMS**, and **Logs**. |
   | Masked Object Types | The blocking scope. Valid values: **All**, **Tenant**, and **Server**. The options vary with the setting of **Application**. |
   | Blocking Object | The alert objects that use the alert rule. You can select specific alert objects as needed. </br>If you select **All**, you can select **Excluded Objects** on the right to exclude objects that do not need to be blocked.  |
   | Mask Alert Rules | Select one or more alert items to be blocked.  |
   | Label | Specify one or more tags to block alerts for specific metrics, for example, slow SQL alerts. You can filter SQL statements by their IDs. You can add up to eight tags.   |
   | Blocking End Time | Specify the end time for the blocking condition. The blocked alerts will not be reported before the end time expires.  <ul><li>Click the **End Time** field to select the end time. </li>   <li> You can also click a time next to the **End Time** field. For example, if you click **6 Hours**, the system enters the time six hours later from the current time to the End Time field. </li></ul> |
   | Daily Block Period | You can toggle on the **Daily Block Period** switch, and specify the start time and end time. The system blocks alerts during the specified period every day. |

   If you want to block a specific alert, you can add a tag to exactly match the alert. The following example shows how to block a slow SQL alert for the **meta2** tenant in the **adminMT** cluster.

   * (Optional) Add a tag named **ob_cluster** and set the tag value to the cluster name, which is **adminMT**.
   * (Optional) Add a tag named **ob_cluster_id** and set the tag value to the cluster ID, which is **15**. The cluster ID is used to distinguish between primary and standby clusters.
   * (Optional) Add a tag named **tenant_name** and set the tag value to the tenant name, which is **meta2**.
   * Add a tag named **sql_id** and set the tag value to the ID of the slow SQL statement.

   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>The system blocks an alert only when the alert matches all the tags. The <b>optional</b> configurations are intended to help you better understand and use tags. You can ignore these configurations in practice. </p>
   </main>

5. Click **OK**.

   The system returns to the **Blocking Conditions** list, which contains the newly created condition.

   By default, all alert blocking conditions are displayed in the **Blocking Conditions** list.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <ul>
   <li>After an alert blocking condition is created, it takes effect within 30s. </li>
       <li>Alert blocking conditions that have been expired for more than 7 days are not displayed in the <b>Blocking Conditions</b> list. </li>
   </ul>
   </main>
