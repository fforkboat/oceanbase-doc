# INTERSECT

`INTERSECT` operators perform an intersection-set operation on the output of the left and right suboperators and deduplicate the result.

OceanBase Database supports the following types of `INTERSECT` operators: `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` and `HASH INTERSECT DISTINCT`.

## MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT

In the following example, Q1 connects the two queries with the `INTERSECT` operator, a sorting method is available for `c1`, and the `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator is used as the No. 0 operator to obtain the intersection set and deduplicate the result. No sorting method is available for `c2`, so a `SORT` operator is assigned before the No. 3 operator for sorting. When these operators are executed, they read ordered inputs from the left and right subnodes and merge and deduplicate the rows to obtain the intersection set.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1,1);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2,2);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

Q1:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT c1 FROM t1 INTERSECT SELECT c2 FROM t1\G

Query Plan:
=================================================
|ID|OPERATOR                |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
-------------------------------------------------
|0 |MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT|    |2        |77  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN             |T1  |2        |37  |
|2 | SORT                   |    |2        |39  |
|3 |  TABLE SCAN            |T1  |2        |37  |
=================================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([INTERSECT(T1.C1, T1.C2)]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C1]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C2, ASC])
  3 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display shows in detail the output information of the `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator.

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | The output expression of the operator.  In this example, the expression uses the `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator to perform the intersection-set operation on the output columns of the two suboperators. Within the brackets are the output columns of the left and right subnodes.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator.  In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator.  |

## HASH INTERSECT DISTINCT

In the following example, Q2 connects the two queries with the `INTERSECT` operator, no sorting method is available, and the `HASH INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator is used as the No. 0 operator to obtain the intersection set and deduplicate the result. When the operator is being executed, it first reads the output of the subnode on one side, creates a hash table, and removes duplicate rows. Then, it reads the output of the subnode on the other side and uses the hash table to generate the intersection set and deduplicate the result.

```sql
Q2:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT c2 FROM t1 INTERSECT SELECT c2 FROM t1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
================================================
|ID|OPERATOR               |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
------------------------------------------------
|0 |HASH INTERSECT DISTINCT|    |2        |77  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN            |T1  |2        |37  |
|2 | TABLE SCAN            |T1  |2        |37  |
================================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([INTERSECT(T1.C2, T1.C2)]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display shows in detail the output information of the `HASH INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator. The fields of the operator have the same meaning as those of the `MERGE INTERSECT DISTINCT` operator.
