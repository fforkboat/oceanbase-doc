# EXCEPT/MINUS

`EXCEPT` operators perform a difference-set operation on the output of the left and right suboperators and deduplicate the result.

Generally, the `MINUS` operator is used in Oracle mode to perform difference set operations, whereas `EXCEPT` operators are used in MySQL mode to perform difference set operations. In OceanBase Database, however, both `EXCEPT` and `MINUS` operators can be used for difference-set operations in MySQL mode.

OceanBase Database supports the following types of `EXCEPT` operators: `MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT` and `HASH EXCEPT DISTINCT`.

## MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT

In the following example, Q1 uses the `MINUS` operator to connect the two queries, a sorting method is available for `c1`, and the `MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator is used as the No. 0 operator to obtain the difference set and deduplicate the result. No sorting method is available for `c2`, so a `SORT` operator is assigned before the No. 3 operator for sorting. When these operators are executed, they read ordered inputs from the left and right subnodes and merge and deduplicate the rows to generate the difference set.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1,1);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2,2);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

Q1:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT c1 FROM t1 MINUS SELECT c2 FROM t1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
==============================================
|ID|OPERATOR             |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
----------------------------------------------
|0 |MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT|    |2        |77  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN          |T1  |2        |37  |
|2 | SORT                |    |2        |39  |
|3 |  TABLE SCAN         |T1  |2        |37  |
==============================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([MINUS(T1.C1, T1.C2)]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C1]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C2, ASC])
  3 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display shows in detail the output information of the `MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator.

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | The output expression of the operator.  In this example, the expression uses the `EXCEPT` or `MINUS` operator to perform the difference-set operation on the output columns of the two suboperators. `MINUS` is used in Oracle mode, while EXCEPT is used in MySQL mode. Within the brackets are the output columns of the left and right subnodes.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator.  In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator.  |

## HASH EXCEPT DISTINCT

In the following example, Q2 uses the `MINUS` operator to connect the two queries, no sorting method is available, and the `HASH EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator is used as the No. 0 operator to generate the difference set and deduplicate the result. When the operator is being executed, it first reads the output of the left subnode to create a hash table and removes duplicate rows. Then, it reads the output of the right subnode and uses the hash table to generate the difference set and deduplicate the result.

```sql
Q2:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT c2 FROM t1 MINUS SELECT c2 FROM t1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
=============================================
|ID|OPERATOR            |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
---------------------------------------------
|0 |HASH EXCEPT DISTINCT|    |2        |77  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN         |T1  |2        |37  |
|2 | TABLE SCAN         |T1  |2        |37  |
=============================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([MINUS(T1.C2, T1.C2)]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display shows in detail the output information of the `HASH EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator. The fields of the operator have the same meaning as those of the `MERGE EXCEPT DISTINCT` operator.
