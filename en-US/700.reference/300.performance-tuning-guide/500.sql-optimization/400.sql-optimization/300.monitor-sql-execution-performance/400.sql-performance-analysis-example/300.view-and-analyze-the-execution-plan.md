# View and analyze the shape of an execution plan

To view the shape of an execution plan and analyze the plan, perform the following steps:

1. Run the `EXPLAIN` command to view the shape of the execution plan, or view the cached execution plan by real-time execution plan display. For more information, see [Overview](../../../200.sql-execution-plan/100.introduction-to-sql-execution-plans.md) and [Real-time execution plan display](../../../200.sql-execution-plan/500.real-time-execution-plan-display.md).

2. Analyze the execution plan to determine whether your selection of the index, join order, and join algorithm is reasonable and correct. For more information, see [Access path](../../600.query-optimization/100.access-path/100.access-path-overview.md), [Join order](../../600.query-optimization/200.join-algorithm/300.join-order.md), and [Join algorithm](../../600.query-optimization/200.join-algorithm/200.join-algorithm.md).
