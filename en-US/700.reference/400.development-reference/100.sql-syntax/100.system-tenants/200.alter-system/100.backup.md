# BACKUP

## Purpose

You can use this statement to trigger a backup. For more information about how to back up and restore data in OceanBase Database, see **"Backup and restoration management"** in OceanBase Database Administrator Guide.

This statement can be executed only in the sys tenant.

## Syntax

```sql
alter_system_backup_stmt:
    ALTER SYSTEM backup_action;

backup_action:
      SET BACKUP_DEST = 'backup_url'
    | SET BACKUP_BACKUP_DEST = 'backup_backup_url'
    | ARCHIVELOG | NOARCHIVELOG
    | BACKUP DATABASE | BACKUP ARCHIVELOG
    | BACKUP BACKUPPIECE ALL NOT BACKED UP n TIMES [tenant_identifier] [BACKUP_BACKUP_DEST='url']
    | BACKUP BACKUPPIECE [= n] [tenant_identifier] [BACKUP_BACKUP_DEST='url'] [WITH ACTIVE BACKUPPIECE]
    | BACKUP BACKUPSET ALL NOT BACKED UP n TIMES [tenant_identifier] [BACKUP_BACKUP_DEST='url']
    | BACKUP BACKUPSET = n [tenant_identifier] [BACKUP_BACKUP_DEST='url']
    | CANCEL BACKUP [BACKUPSET | BACKUPPIECE]
    | {START | STOP} BACKUP ARCHIVELOG
    | BACKUP TENANT tenant_name_list TO backup_destination


tenant_identifier:
     TENANT_ID = tenant_id | TENANT_NAME = 'name'

tenant_name_list:
      tenant_name [, tenant_name ...]
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| BACKUP_DEST = 'backup_url' | The path to store backups. You can set it to an Object Storage Service (OSS) bucket or a file. For more information about the syntax, see the following example.  |
| BACKUP_BACKUP_DEST = 'backup_backup_url' | The path to store the secondary backup. You can set it to an OSS bucket or a file.  |
| ARCHIVELOG \| NOARCHIVELOG | Enables or disables log backup.  <br>**Note**: To initiate backup faster, we recommend that you trigger a minor compaction before enabling log backup. This is because log backup starts from the last minor compaction.  |
| BACKUP DATABASE | Triggers a baseline backup (only cluster-level backup is supported).  |
| BACKUP BACKUPPIECE | Performs secondary backup on log backups.  <ul><li> `ALL NOT BACKED UP n TIMES`: performs secondary backup on log backups whose number of copies is less than n. </li>   <li> `[= n]`: performs secondary backup on log backups with the specified BACKUPPIECE ID. If you specify `WITH ACTIVE BACKUPPIECE`, the active log backup will also be backed up. </li></ul> |
| BACKUP BACKUPSET | Performs secondary backup on data backups.  <ul><li> `ALL NOT BACKED UP n TIMES`: performs secondary backup on data backups whose number of copies is less than n. </li>   <li> `= n`: performs secondary backup on data backups with the specified BACKUPSET ID. </li></ul> |
| CANCEL BACKUP | Cancels the current baseline backup.  |
| CANCEL BACKUP {BACKUPSET \| BACKUPPIECE} | Cancels the secondary backup on current backups.  <ul><li> `BACKUPSET`: cancels the ongoing secondary backup on data backups.  </li>   <li> `BACKUPPIECE`: cancels the ongoing secondary backup on log backups.     <br>**Note**: The system resumes the data backup process if you initiate a data backup task again.  For more information about how to use `BACKUP BACKUPPIECE`, see **"Perform secondary backup on multiple backup directories"** under **"Perform secondary backup"** in OceanBase Database Administrator Guide. </li></ul> |
| {START \| STOP} BACKUP ARCHIVELOG | Starts or stops automatic secondary backup on log backups.  <br>**Note**: `BACKUP ARCHIVELOG` is not recommended. We recommend that you use `BACKUP BACKUPPIECE`.  For more information about how to use `BACKUP ARCHIVELOG`, see **"Secondary backup on logs in the splitting disabled mode"** under **"Perform secondary backup"** in OceanBase Database Administrator Guide.  |
| TENANT_ID = tenant_id | The ID of the tenant.  |
| TENANT_NAME = 'name' | The name of the tenant.  |
| tenant_name_list | The list of tenants whose data is to be backed up.  Currently, you can add up to 256 tenants.  |
| backup_destination | The destination that stores the backups.  Currently, OSS, Network File System (NFS), and Cloud Object Storage (COS) can serve as the backup destination.  |

## Examples

* Set the path to store the backup data.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET backup_dest='oss://antsys-oceanbasebackup/backup_dir?host=xxx&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx';
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET backup_dest='file:///data/nfs/physical_backup_dir';
   ```

* Performs secondary backup on log backups.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP BACKUPPIECE ALL NOT BACKED UP 2 TIMES BACKUP_BACKUP_DEST= 'file:///ob_backup_backup/ob_cluster_1_backup_piece_20200125';
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP BACKUPPIECE 1 TENANT_NAME tenant_1 BACKUP_BACKUP_DEST= 'file:///ob_backup_backup/ob_cluster_1_backup_piece_20200225';
   ```

* Perform a backup at the tenant level.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP TENANT tenant1,tenant2 TO "file:///ob_backup/";
   ```
