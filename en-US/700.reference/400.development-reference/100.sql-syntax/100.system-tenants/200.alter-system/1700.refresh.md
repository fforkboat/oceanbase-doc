# REFRESH

## Purpose

You can use this statement to trigger a refresh operation, including refreshing the schema, time zone information, and various caches.

This statement can be executed only in the sys tenant.

## Syntax

```sql
alter_system_refresh_stmt:
  ALTER SYSTEM refresh_action;

refresh_action:
  REFRESH SCHEMA
  | REFRESH TIME_ZONE_INFO

```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| REFRESH SCHEMA | Refreshes the schema.  <br>**Note**: When the system performs DDL operations, Root Service notifies all OBServer nodes to refresh the schema. If some OBServer nodes are disconnected from Root Service due to exceptions, you must manually refresh the schema on them.  |
| REFRESH TIME_ZONE_INFO | Notifies all servers in the cluster to update the local time zone information.  <br>**Note**: The current version does not support this parameter.  |


## Examples

Refresh the schema.

```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM REFRESH SCHEMA;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
