|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ip_port | The IP address and port number of the OBServer node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| zone | If a zone is specified, zone verification is performed for the server to be maintained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ADD | Adds an OBServer node.  `ADD` adds an OBServer node to the service list. Only OBServer nodes in the service list can provide services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| DELETE | Deletes an OBServer node.  `DELETE` removes an OBServer node from the service list only after the OBServer node is cleared. This statement can cause unit migration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| CANCEL DELETE | Cancels the deletion of an OBServer node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| START | Starts the OBServer node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| STOP | Stops an OBServer node.  `STOP` checks if the majority of replicas are still available after an OBServer node is stopped, and waits until the CLOGs are synchronized and the Leader replica is moved to another node (namely, leader re-election).                                                                                                                                                                        |
| FORCE STOP | Force stops an OBServer node.  `FORCE STOP` checks if the majority of replicas are still available after an OBServer node is stopped, and waits until the Leader replica is moved to another node (namely, leader re-election).  <br>**Notice**: Force stopping an OBServer node is not a common O&M operation. This operation is not secure as it does not wait until the CLOGs are synchronized. It is not recommended. |
| ISOLATE | Isolates the failed OBServer node, so that new read/write requests are not routed to the isolated failed server.  `ISOLATE` does not wait until the Leader replica is switched to another node (namely, leader re-election).                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Examples

Add an OBServer node (`xxx.xx.xxx.xx1`) to a cluster.

```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM ADD SERVER 'xxx.xx.xxx.xx1:xxxx' ZONE 'zone1';
```
