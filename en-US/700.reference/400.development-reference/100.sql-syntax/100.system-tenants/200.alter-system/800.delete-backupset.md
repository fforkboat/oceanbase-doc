```

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>When you execute the <code>DELETE BACKUPSET</code> statement to clear backup sets, the following limits apply:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If the <code>backup_dest</code> of the <code>backup_set_id</code> to be deleted is the same as the destination specified in the <code>backup_dest</code> configuration item, at least one complete and valid backup copy is retained. <code></code><code></code>Otherwise, the constraint of retaining one valid backup copy does not apply. </li>
    <li>If the <code>backup_dest</code> of the <code>backup_set_id</code> to be deleted is the same as the destination specified in the <code>backup_dest</code> configuration item, the<code> </code>backup sets must be deleted in a specific order. For example,<code> </code>backup sets with <code>backup_set_id</code> of 1, 2, and 3 must be deleted in the order of 1 first, followed by 2, and 3 last. Otherwise, the constraint on the deletion order of backup sets<code> </code>does<code> </code>not<code> </code>apply. </li>
    <li>The statement fails if the specified <code>backup_set_id</code> does not exist, or the backup of the specified <code>backup_set_id</code> is still ongoing. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------------|
| backup_set_id | The ID of the` `backup set corresponding to the backup to be cleared. An ID is generated when a backup is initiated. The ID can be queried in the `CDB_OB_BACKUP_SET_DETAILS` view.  <br>**Note**: The `BS_KEY` field in the `CDB_OB_BACKUP_SET_DETAILS` view corresponds to `backup_set_id`.  |
| copy_id | To clear the specified secondary backup, you need to specify `copy_id`, which indicates the data backup with specified `<backup_set_id, copy_id>`. You can find `copy_id` in the `CDB_OB_BACKUP_SET_DETAILS` view.  |

## Examples

1. View the backup operations that have been performed.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM CDB_OB_BACKUP_SET_DETAILS;
   ```

2. Clear the backups whose `backup_set_id` and `copy_id` are both `1`.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM DELETE BACKUPSET 1 COPY 1;
   ```
