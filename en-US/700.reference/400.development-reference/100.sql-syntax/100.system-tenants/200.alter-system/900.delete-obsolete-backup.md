# DELETE OBSOLETE BACKUP

## Purpose

You can use this statement to clear expired backup data.

Set the expiration time `backup_recovery_window` before you use this statement to clear expired backup data. `backup_recovery_window` specifies the time window in which backup data can be restored, counting from now on. This parameter is used to check whether a backup set has expired. The default value is `0`, indicating that the system does not check whether the backup set has expired. We recommend that you set it to `7d`, meaning that the backup data is retained for one week. In this way, you can restore the backup sets created in the last `7` days and other backup sets are deleted. If automatic backup clearing is enabled, when the backup expires, the system automatically clears it.

For more information about `backup_recovery_window`, see **"System parameters"** in the OceanBase Database Reference Guide.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM DELETE OBSOLETE BACKUP;
```

## Examples

Set the expiration time of backup data to one week, after which the backup data will be cleared.

```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET backup_recovery_window = '7d';
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM DELETE OBSOLETE BACKUP;
```
