# ALTER RESOURCE POOL

## Purpose

You can use this statement to modify a resource pool.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER RESOURCE POOL {
    pool_name
    UNIT [=] unit_name,
    UNIT_NUM [=] unit_num [DELETE UNIT = (unit_id_list)],
    ZONE_LIST [=] ('zone_name' [, 'zone_name' ...])
 | MERGE
   ('pool_name'[, 'pool_name' ...])
    INTO ('merge_pool_name')
 | SPLIT INTO ('pool_name' [, 'pool_name' ...])
   ON ('zone_name' [, 'zone_name' ...])
};
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| unit_name | The name of the resource unit to be used.  |
| unit_num | The number of units in a zone after the modification, which must be less than or equal to the number of OBServer nodes in the zone. <blockquote>**Notice**</br>After a resource pool is allocated to a tenant, you cannot use the `ALTER RESOURCE POOL` statement to change the number of units in the resource pool. Instead, you must use the `ALTER RESOURCE TENANT` statement. For more information, see [ALTER RESOURCE TENANT](3.alter-resource-tenant.md). </blockquote> |
| unit_id_list | When you attempt to decrease the value of `unit_num`, you can use the `DELETE UNIT` keyword to specify the units to be deleted.  If the `DELETE UNIT` parameter is not specified, the system automatically selects the units to be deleted.  <br>**Notice**: When you use the `DELETE UNIT` keyword to explicitly specify the `unit_id` parameters of the units to be deleted, the following conditions must be met: <ul><li> In the `unit_id` list, the number of units to be deleted from each zone must be the same. If different numbers of units are to be deleted from the zones in the list, the scale-in operation is invalid. </li>   <li> In the `unit_id` list, the number of units to be deleted from each zone must be the same as the value of the `unit_num` parameter. </li></ul> |
| ZONE_LIST | The zone list of the resource pool.  |
| MERGE | Merges multiple resource pools.  The resource pools can still be used by the tenant when they are being merged. They are merged into one resource pool only from the perspective of the management layer in which the Root Service is located, to facilitate unified maintenance.  |
| SPLIT | Splits a resource pool into multiple resource pools.  |
| merge_pool_name | The name of the merged resource pool.  |

## Examples

* You can modify only one attribute of resource pool `pool1` at a time. For example, the following statement attempts to modify the `UNIT`, `UNIT_NUM`, and `ZONE` attributes at a time, and an error will occur during its execution.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER RESOURCE POOL pool1 UNIT='unit2', UNIT_NUM=1, ZONE_LIST=('zone1');
   ERROR 1235 (0A000): alter unit_num, resource_unit, zone_list in one cmd not supported
   ```

   When you attempt to decrease the value of `UNIT_NUM`, you can specify the units to be deleted.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER RESOURCE POOL pool1 UNIT_NUM=1 DELETE UNIT = (1002);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

* Modify the `UNIT` attribute of resource pool `pool1`.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER RESOURCE POOL pool1 UNIT='unit2';
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

* Split resource pool `pool1` into resource pools `pool10` and `pool11`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE RESOURCE POOL pool1 unit='unit1',unit_num=1,zone_list=('zone1','zone2');
   Query OK, 0 rows affected


   obclient> ALTER RESOURCE POOL pool1 SPLIT INTO ('pool10','pool11') ON ('zone1','zone2');
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

* Merge resource pools `pool0`, `pool1`, and `pool2` of `tenant1` for unified management.

   ```sql
   obclient>ALTER RESOURCE POOL MERGE ('pool0','pool1','pool2') INTO ('pool3');
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```
