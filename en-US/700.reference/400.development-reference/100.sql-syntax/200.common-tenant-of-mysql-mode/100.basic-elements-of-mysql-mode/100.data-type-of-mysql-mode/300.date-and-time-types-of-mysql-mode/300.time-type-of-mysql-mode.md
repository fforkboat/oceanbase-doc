# TIME type

The `TIME` type can indicate a point in time during a day, the elapsed period, or the time interval between two events, which may be much longer than 24 hours.

OceanBase Database allows you to assign string or numeric values to a `TIME` column.

A `TIME` value is searched and displayed in the `'hh:mm:ss'` format. Value range: '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'.

A `TIME` value can also be displayed in the `'hh:mm:ss[.fraction]'` format where the fractional part can contain up to six decimal places, which means the time can be accurate to microseconds. Value range: '-838:59:59.000000' to '838:59:59.000000'. The fractional part is separated from other digits with a decimal point. Other separators are not recognized.

Syntax:

```sql
TIME[(fsp)]
```

The optional parameter `fsp` specifies the precision of the fractional part. Value range: \[0,6\]. The value 0 indicates that the time value does not have the fractional part. If you omit this parameter, the default value 0 is used.
