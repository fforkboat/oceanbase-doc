# DELETE

## Purpose

You can use this statement to delete rows that meet the conditions from one or more tables.

Direct DELETE operations on subqueries are not supported for either a single table or multiple tables. For example, the following statement cannot be executed: `DELETE FROM (SELECT * FROM t1);`.

## Syntax

```sql
Single-Table-Delete Syntax:
    DELETE [hint_options] FROM table_name
    [PARTITION (partition_name,...)]
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [ORDER BY order_expression_list]
    [LIMIT row_count]

Multiple-Table-Delete Syntax:
    DELETE [hint_options] table_name[.*] [, table_name[.*]] ...
    FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]
Or:
    DELETE [hint_options] FROM table_name[.*] [, table_name[.*]] ...
    USING table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]

where_condition:
    expression

order_expression_list:
    order_expression [, order_expression ...]

order_expression:
    expression [ASC | DESC]

limit_row_count:
    INT_VALUE

table_references:
    {table_name | joined_table | table_subquery | select_with_parents} [, ...]

```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| hint_options | Specifies the `hint` options.  |
| table_name | The name of the table to be deleted.  |
| partition_name | The name of the partition in the table to be deleted.  |
| where_condition | The filtering condition that must be met for a table to be deleted.  |
| order_expression_list | The list of sort keys for the table to be deleted.  |
| row_count | The number of rows of the table to be deleted. The specified value must be an integer.  |
| table_references | The sequence of tables to be selected when you delete data from two or more tables.  |

## Examples

Execute the following statement to create tables t1 and t2 and insert data into them:

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected
obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  1 |    1 |
|  2 |    2 |
|  3 |    3 |
|  4 |    4 |
+----+------+
4 rows in set

obclient> CREATE TABLE t2(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT) PARTITION BY KEY(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  5 |    5 |
|  1 |    1 |
|  2 |    2 |
|  3 |    3 |
+----+------+
4 rows in set
```

* Delete data in a single table: Delete rows where `c1 = 2`. The `c1` column is the primary key column of the `t1` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> DELETE FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 2;
   Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  1 |    1 |
   |  3 |    3 |
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

* Delete data in a single table: Delete the data in the first row sorted by the `c2` column from the `t1` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> DELETE FROM t1 ORDER BY c2 LIMIT 1;
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  2 |    2 |
   |  3 |    3 |
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

* Delete data in a single table: Delete data in the `p2` partition from the `t2` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> DELETE FROM t2 PARTITION(p2);
   Query OK, 3 rows affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  5 |    5 |
   +----+------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* Delete data in multiple tables: Delete rows where `t1.c1 = t2.c1` from tables `t1` and `t2`.

   ```sql
   obclient> DELETE t1, t2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1;
   Query OK, 3 rows affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   1 row in set

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  5 |    5 |
   +----+------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* Delete data in multiple tables: Delete rows where `t1.c1 = t2.c1` from tables `t1` and `t2`.

   ```sql
   obclient> DELETE FROM t1, t2 USING t1,t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1;
   Query OK, 6 rows affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   1 row in set

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  5 |    5 |
   +----+------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* Delete data in multiple tables: Delete data from partition `p2` of table `t2` and rows where `t1.c1 = t2.c1` from table `t1`.

   ```sql
   obclient> DELETE t2 FROM t1,t2 PARTITION(p2) WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1;
   Query OK, 3 rows affected

   obclient> select * from t2;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  5 |    5 |
   +----+------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* Delete data from an updatable view named `v`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> DELETE FROM v WHERE v.c1 = 1;
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM v;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  2 |    2 |
   |  3 |    3 |
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```
