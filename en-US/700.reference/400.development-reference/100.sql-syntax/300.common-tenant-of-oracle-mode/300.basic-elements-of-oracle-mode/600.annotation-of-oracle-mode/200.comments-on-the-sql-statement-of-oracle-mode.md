# Comments within SQL statements

Comments within SQL statements can make your application easier to read and maintain. A comment can be placed between any keywords, parameters, or punctuation marks in a statement.

For example, you can add a comment in a statement to describe the purpose of the statement in your application. Comments, except for hints, within SQL statements have no effect on the execution of the statement.

You can add a comment to a statement in one of the following ways:

* Start the comment with a slash and an asterisk (/\*).

   Add the comment text after the slash and the asterisk. The text can span multiple lines and must end with an asterisk and a slash (\*/). Spaces or line breakers are not required between the comment content and opening or closing characters.

* Start the comment with two hyphens (--).

   Add the comment text after the two hyphens. The text cannot extend to a new line and must end with a line break.

An SQL statement can contain multiple comments in both styles. The comment text can contain any printable character in the database character set.

The following example shows a comment that starts with a slash and an asterisk (/\*).

```sql
SELECT last_name, employee_id, salary + NVL(commission_pct, 0),
            job_id, e.department_id
  /* Select all employees whose compensation is
  greater than that of Pataballa.*/
  FROM employees e, departments d
  /*The DEPARTMENTS table is used to get the department name.*/
  WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
    AND salary + NVL(commission_pct,0) >   /* Subquery:       */
       (SELECT salary + NVL(commission_pct,0)
         /* total compensation is salary + commission_pct */
         FROM employees
         WHERE last_name = 'Pataballa')
  ORDER BY last_name, employee_id;
```

The following example shows a comment that starts with two hyphens (--).

```sql
SELECT last_name,                                   -- select the name
       employee_id                                  -- employee id
       salary + NVL(commission_pct, 0),             -- total compensation
       job_id,                                      -- job
       e.department_id                              -- and department
  FROM employees e,                                 -- of all employees
       departments d
  WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
    AND salary + NVL(commission_pct, 0) >           -- whose compensation
                                                    -- is greater than
        (SELECT salary + NVL(commission_pct,0)      -- the compensation
          FROM employees
          WHERE last_name = 'Pataballa')            -- of Pataballa
  ORDER BY last_name                                -- and order by last name
           employee_id                              -- and employee id.
;
```
