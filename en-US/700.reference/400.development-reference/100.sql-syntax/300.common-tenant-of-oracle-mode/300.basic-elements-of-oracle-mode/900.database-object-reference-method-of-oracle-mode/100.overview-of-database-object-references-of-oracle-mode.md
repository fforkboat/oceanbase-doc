# Overview

OceanBase Database allows you to reference schema objects in the context of an SQL statement.

The current OceanBase Database version supports the following references:

* Reference to schema objects

* Reference to partition tables and indexes

* Reference to object type attributes and methods

Syntax:

```sql
[ schema. ] object [ .part ]
```

Parameters:

* `object`: the name of the object.

* `schema`: the schema that includes objects. This qualifier allows you to reference objects of another schema after you are granted the required privileges. If this qualifier is not specified, you reference objects in your schema by default.

   `schema` applies only to schema objects, such as tables, views, indexes, partitions, sequences, synonyms, triggers, and PL objects, including PL sub-programs, packages, and triggers. It does not apply to nonschema objects such as users, roles, tablespaces, and directories. Public synonyms are an exception. You can use "`PUBLIC`" to qualify the reference to a public synonym. The quotation marks must not be omitted.

* `part`: a part of an object. You can use this qualifier to reference a part of a schema object, such as a column or partition of a table. However, it does not apply to all types of objects.
