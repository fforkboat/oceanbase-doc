# Create a database link

To reference an object in another database, you must add, after the object name, the name of the database link that points to this database. A database link is a schema object that enables OceanBase Database to connect to a remote database to access the objects in the remote database.

You can use the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` statement to create a database link. You must specify the following information when you use this statement:

* Tenant name, username, and password.

* URL and port number

OceanBase Database stores the preceding information in the data dictionary.

Limitations on creating database links:

* You can create only a link that connects two Oracle tenants of OceanBase Database. In OceanBase Database, you cannot create a database link that points to an Oracle database.

* You can create and delete database links for a tenant. A tenant can have at most 15 database links.
