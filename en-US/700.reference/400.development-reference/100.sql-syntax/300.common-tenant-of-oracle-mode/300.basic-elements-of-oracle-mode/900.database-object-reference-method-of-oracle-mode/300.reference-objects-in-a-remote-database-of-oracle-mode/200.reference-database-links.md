# Reference a database link

When you issue an SQL statement that contains a database link, you must use the complete database link name stored in the data dictionary.

OceanBase Database uses a connection string to access a remote database. If OceanBase Database successfully connects to the remote database by using the connection string, username, and password, it uses the rules in the referenced schema object to access specified objects in the remote database. Pay attention to the following limitations:

* You can execute only read-only statements.

* You can access only table objects but cannot access other objects such as views and sequences.

* When you access a table object, you must explicitly specify the database name, such as `test.t1@my_link`.

* Some plans and operators are not supported.
