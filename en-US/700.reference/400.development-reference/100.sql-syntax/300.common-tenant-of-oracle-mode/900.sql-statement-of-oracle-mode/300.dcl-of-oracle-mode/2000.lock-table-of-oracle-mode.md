# LOCK TABLE

## Purpose

You can use this statement to lock one or more tables, partitions, or subpartitions in specified mode.

A locked table remains locked until the transaction is committed, rolled back, or rolled back to the savepoint before the table is locked.


<main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The table to be locked must be in your own schema, or you must have the <code>LOCK ANY TABLE</code> privilege. </p>
</main>

## Syntax

```sql
LOCK TABLE [ schema. ]  table_name
IN lock_mode MODE
[ NOWAIT  
  | WAIT integer
   ] ;
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| table_name | The name of the table to be locked.  |
| lock_mode | The lock mode. The current version of OceanBase Database supports the following lock modes:<ul><li>`ROW SHARE`: allows concurrent access to a locked table, but prohibits users from locking the entire table for exclusive access. </li><li> `ROW EXCLUSIVE`: functions in the same way as `ROW SHARE`, but prohibits users from locking tables in SHARE mode. A `ROW EXCLUSIVE` lock is automatically obtained in an UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE operation. </li><li> `SHARE`: allows concurrent queries, but prohibits users from updating locked tables.  </li><li>  `SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE`: allows a user to view the entire table and other users to view the rows in the table, but prohibits other users from locking the table or updating the rows in `SHARE` mode. </li><li> `EXCLUSIVE`: allows only queries to locked tables, but prohibits other operations to the tables. </li></ul> |
| NOWAIT | This keyword instructs the database to immediately return the control to you if a lock contention occurs when you attempt to lock a table, partition, or subpartition. In this case, the database returns a message indicating that the table, partition, or subpartition is locked by another user.  |
| WAIT | This keyword instructs the database to wait for the release of the lock until timeout if a lock contention occurs. The value of `integer` is not limited. <br>**Note**: <br/>The current version of OceanBase Database does not support the `NOTWAIT` or `WAIT` keyword. The timeout period of the statement or transaction, whichever is shorter, is used. That is, the statement waits for the lock until the statement or transaction times out.</br> |

## Examples

Lock the `tbl1` table in `EXCLUSIVE` mode, without waiting if another user has locked the table.

```sql
obclient> LOCK TABLE tbl1 IN EXCLUSIVE MODE NOWAIT;
Query OK, 0 row affected
```
