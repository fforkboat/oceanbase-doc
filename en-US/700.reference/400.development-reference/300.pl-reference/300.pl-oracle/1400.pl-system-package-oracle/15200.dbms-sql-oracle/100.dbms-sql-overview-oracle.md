Overview
================================

The `DBMS_SQL` package provides a set of mechanisms to execute dynamic SQL statements, including system commands such as `ALTER SESSION`, DDL statements, and DML statements such as `SELECT`.

    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>
  </main>

Note the following points:

* Parameters can only be specified in DML statements.

* For DML statements, only statements that return a result set can be obtained.

* DML statements are executed in the `dbms_sql.execute` interface, other statements are executed in the `dbms_sql.parse` interface.

* A cursor created by `DBMS_SQL` can only be used in the session where it is created and is not accessible to other sessions.


Privileges
----------------------------------

`DBMS_SQL` is owned by the `SYS` user and is compiled with `AUTHID CURRENT_USER`. A `DBMS_SQL` subprogram called from an anonymous PL block runs with the privileges of the current user.

DBMS_SQL constants
--------------------------------

The following table describes the `DBMS_SQL` constants that are used with the `language_flag` parameter of the `PARSE` stored procedure.


| Name | Type | Value | Description |
|--------|---------|---|-----------|
| NATIVE | INTEGER | 1 | Normal connection from the program to the database. |



Considerations
-------------------------

The following operational notes describe how query, update, insert, and delete operations are handled.

If you are using dynamic SQL to process a query, then you must perform the following steps:

1. Specify the variables that receive the return value of `SELECT` statements by calling the `DEFINE_COLUMN` subprogram.

2. Execute the `SELECT` statement by calling the `EXECUTE` function.

3. Retrieve the rows that satisfy your query by calling the `FETCH_ROWS` function.

4. Determine the value of a column returned by `FETCH_ROWS` for your query by calling the `COLUMN_VALUE` subprogram.


If you are using dynamic SQL to process an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement, the statement must be executed by calling the `EXECUTE` function.

DBMS_SQL execution process
----------------------------------

The execution process of `DBMS_SQL` is:

1. `OPEN_CURSOR`

2. `PARSE`

3. `BIND_VARIABLE`

4. `DEFINE_COLUMN`, `DEFINE_COLUMN_LONG`, or `DEFINE_ARRAY`

5. `EXECUTE`

6. `FETCH_ROWS` or `EXECUTE_AND_FETCH`

7. `COLUMN_VALUE`

8. `CLOSE_CURSOR`


Subprograms
-----------------------

The following table describes the `DBMS_SQL` subprograms supported by the current OceanBase Database version.


| **Subprogram** | **Description** |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| [BIND_VARIABLE](2.bind-variable-oracle.md) | Binds a specified value to a specified variable.  |
| [COLUMN_VALUE](4.column-value-oracle.md) | Returns the value of a specified cursor element.  |
| [CLOSE_CURSOR](3.close-cursor-oracle.md) | Closes a specified cursor and releases the occupied memory.  |
| [DEFINE_COLUMN](5.define-column-oracle.md) | Defines a column to be selected from a specified cursor. This subprogram is only used with `SELECT` statements.  |
| [DEFINE_ARRAY](6.define-array-oracle.md) | Defines a set to be selected from a specified cursor. It is applicable only to `SELECT` statements.  |
| [DESCRIBE_COLUMNS](7.describe-columns-oracle.md) | Describes all attributes of the cursor, such as the field name and type.  |
| [EXECUTE](8.execute-oracle.md) | Executes a specified cursor.  |
| [EXECUTE_AND_FETCH](9.execute-and-fetch-oracle.md) | Executes a specified cursor and fetches rows.  |
| [FETCH_ROWS](10.fetch-rows-oracle.md) | Fetches a row of data from a specified cursor.  |
| [IS_OPEN](11.is-open-oracle.md) | Returns `TRUE` if the specified cursor is in the `OPEN` state.  |
| [OPEN_CURSOR](12.open-cursor-oracle.md) | The ID of the new cursor is returned.  |
| [PARSE](13.parse-oracle.md) | Parses a specified statement.  |
