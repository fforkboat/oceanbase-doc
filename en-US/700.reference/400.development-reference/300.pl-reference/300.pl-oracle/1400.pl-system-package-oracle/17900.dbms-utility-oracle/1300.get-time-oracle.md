Syntax
-----------------------

```sql
DBMS_UTILITY.GET_TIME
RETURN NUMBER;
```



Return values
------------------------

The time is the number of hundredths of a second from the point in time at which this function is called.

Considerations
-------------------------

The return value ranges from -2147483648 to 2147483647. The application must consider the sign before the number when determining the interval. For example, in the case of two negative numbers, the application must allow the first number (earlier one) to be greater than the second number (later one) that is closer to 0. Similarly, the application must allow the first number (earlier one) to be negative and the second number (later one) to be positive.
