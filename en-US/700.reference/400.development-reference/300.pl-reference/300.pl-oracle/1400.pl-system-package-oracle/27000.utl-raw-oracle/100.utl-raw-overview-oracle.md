# Overview

The `UTL_RAW` package provides SQL functions that are used to manipulate `RAW` data types.

This package is essential because common SQL functions do not manipulate `RAW` data, while PL does not support overloading between `RAW` and `CHAR` data types.

The `UTL_RAW` package can also be used in other environments in addition to the database environment, and is therefore prefixed with `UTL` instead of `DBMS`.

## Considerations

`UTL_RAW` allows a `RAW` "record" to consist of many elements. By using the `RAW` data type, character set conversion will not be performed. This keeps the `RAW` in its original format when being transferred through remote procedure calls (RPCs).

## Subprograms

The following table describes the `UTL_RAW` subprograms supported by the current OceanBase Database version.


| **Subprogram** | **Description** |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| [BIT_AND](2.bit-and-oracle.md) | Performs the bitwise logical AND operation on values in `RAW r1` and `RAW r2` and returns the result RAW of the AND operation.  |
| [BIT_COMPLEMENT](3.bit-complement-oracle.md) | Performs the bitwise logical COMPLEMENT operation on values in `RAW r` and returns the result `RAW` of the COMPLEMENT operation.  |
| [BIT_OR](4.bit-or-oracle.md) | Performs the bitwise logical OR operation on values in `RAW r1` and `RAW r2` and returns the result RAW of the OR operation.  |
| [BIT_XOR](5.bit-xor-oracle.md) | Performs the bitwise logical XOR operation on values in `RAW r1` and `RAW r2` and returns the result RAW of the XOR operation.  |
| [CAST_FROM_BINARY_DOUBLE](6.cast-from-binary-double-oracle.md) | Returns a `BINARY_DOUBLE` value in the binary `RAW` representation.  |
| [CAST_FROM_BINARY_FLOAT](7.cast-from-binary-float-oracle.md) | Returns a `BINARY_FLOAT` value in the binary `RAW` representation.  |
| [CAST_FROM_BINARY_INTEGER](8.cast-from-binary-integer-oracle.md) | Returns a `BINARY_INTEGER` value in the binary `RAW` representation.  |
| [CAST_FROM_NUMBER](9.cast-from-number-oracle.md) | Returns a `NUMBER` value in the binary `RAW` representation.  |
| [CAST_TO_BINARY_DOUBLE](10.cast-to-binary-double-oracle.md) | Converts a `BINARY_DOUBLE` value in the binary `RAW` representation to a `BINARY_DOUBLE` value.  |
| [CAST_TO_BINARY_FLOAT](11.cast-to-binary-float-oracle.md) | Converts a `BINARY_FLOAT` value in the binary `RAW` representation to a `BINARY_FLOAT` value.  |
| [CAST_TO_BINARY_INTEGER](12.cast-to-binary-integer-oracle.md) | Converts a `BINARY_INTEGER` value in the binary `RAW` representation into a `BINARY_INTEGER` value.  |
| [CAST_TO_NUMBER](13.cast-to-number-oracle.md) | Converts a `NUMBER` value in the binary `RAW` representation to a `NUMBER` value.  |
| [CAST_TO_RAW](14.cast-to-raw-oracle.md) | Converts a `VARCHAR2` value into a `RAW` value.  |
| [CAST_TO_VARCHAR2](15.cast-to-varchar2-oracle.md) | Converts a `RAW` value into a `VARCHAR2` value.  |
| [COPIES](16.compare-oracle.md) | Returns n concatenated copies of `r`.  |
| [COMPARE](17.concat-utl-oracle.md) | Compares `RAW r1` and `RAW r2`.  |
| [CONCAT](18.copies-oracle.md) | Concatenates a maximum of 12 `RAW`s into one `RAW`.  |
| [LENGTH](19.length-utl-oracle.md) | Returns the length of `RAW r` in bytes.  |
| [REVERSE](20.reverse-oracle.md) | Reverses the sequence of bytes in `RAW r` from end to end.  |
| [SUBSTR](21.substr-utl-oracle.md) | Returns `len` bytes starting from `pos` in `RAW r`.  |
