Privileges
----------------------------------

You do not need any special system privileges to use and manage the `DBMS_JOB` package. Only the owner of a job or a user granted the database administrator (DBA) privileges can modify or delete the job.

Usage notes
----------------------------------

`DBMS_JOB` allows a job to run in multiple zones. By default, a job can run in any zone. However, only one zone can be specified for a job. You can specify the name of a zone to bind a job to the zone.

The following describes the procedure for creating, modifying, and running a job associated with a zone. If no associated zone is specified, the job can run in any zone.

1. Call `DBMS_JOB.SUBMIT` to submit the job to the job queue.


2. Call `DBMS_JOB.ZONE` to allocate a zone for running the job.


3. Call `DBMS_JOB.CHANGE` to modify the custom parameters related to the job.


4. Call `DBMS_JOB.RUN` to run the job.


5. Stop the job.
