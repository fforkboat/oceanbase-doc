Parameters
-------------------------



| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| job       | The unique ID of the job to be modified. You can query this ID from the `JOB` column of the `USER_JOBS` or `DBA_JOBS` view.                  |
| broken    | Tags the job as valid or invalid. `TRUE` indicates that the job is tagged as invalid, and `FALSE` indicates that the job is tagged as valid. |
| next_date | The next date for running the job.                                                                                                           |



Usage notes
-------------------------

* Before a job is submitted, it cannot be handled by the job queue in the background.



* If a job has failed 16 consecutive times, it is automatically tagged as broken and stops running.
