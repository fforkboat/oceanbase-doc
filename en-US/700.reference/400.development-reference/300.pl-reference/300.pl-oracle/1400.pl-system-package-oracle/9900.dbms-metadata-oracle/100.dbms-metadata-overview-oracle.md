Privileges
---------------------------

`DBMS_METADATA` is owned by the `SYS` user and has privileges granted to `PUBLIC`. `DBMS_METADATA` is executed with the privileges of the caller, that is, based on the security profile of the caller. It calls `DBMS_METADATA_INT` to perform privileged features.
