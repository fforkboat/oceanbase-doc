Generally, PL static SQL statements use the same syntax as the following SQL statements:

* `SELECT` statement, which is also referred to as a query.



* Data manipulation language (DML) statements: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE`.



* Transaction control language (TCL) statements: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, `SET TRANSACTION`, and `LOCK TABLE`.






A pseudocolumn acts like a normal column, but is not stored in a table. Static SQL statements support the following SQL pseudocolumns:

* `CURRVAL` and `NEXTVAL`



* `LEVEL`



* `OBJECT_VALUE`



* `ROWID`



* `ROWNUM`
