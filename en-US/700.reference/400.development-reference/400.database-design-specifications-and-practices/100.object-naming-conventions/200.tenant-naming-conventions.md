# Tenant naming conventions

Tenants are a unique concept in OceanBase Database, which are similar to instances in architecture. This topic aims to help developers standardize tenant names.

## Recommended naming conventions

* Name a tenant with no more than 64 bytes in lowercase.

* Use a business name or its abbreviation as a tenant name. For example, use the tenant name "deposit" for the tenant in the deposit business.

* If a subsystem of a business system requires an independent tenant, use a name consisting of the business system name or its abbreviation, underscores (_), and the subsystem name, for example, "deposit_account" for the account subsystem of the deposit business.
