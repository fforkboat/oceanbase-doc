# Field naming conventions

When you create a data table, you must follow certain conventions for naming fields. This topic describes how to standardize field names in a database.

## Recommended conventions

* Use either all uppercase letters or all lowercase letters for field names. Do not use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.

* Start field names with letters.

* Use field names that well represent the data content of the column, for example, "NAME".

* Do not start or end field names with underscores (_).

* Do not start field names with digits.

* Do not use reserved words or keywords in field names.

* Do not enclose digits in underscores (_) in field names.

* Do not use plural forms in field names.

* Use the feature names or standard abbreviations in field names. Use underscores (_) for separation in a field name. The "BUSINESS NAME_FIELD FEATURE" form is recommended, for example, "TASK_NUM", "CREATE_DATE", "STATION_DESC", and "TASK_ID".
