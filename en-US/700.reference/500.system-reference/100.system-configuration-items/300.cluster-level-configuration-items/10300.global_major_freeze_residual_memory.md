========================================================

| Default value | 40 |
| Value range | [1, 99] |
| Effective upon restart of OBServer node | No |


The value of `global_major_freeze_residual_memory` is in percentage with memory_limit - system_memory serving as the base. To be specific, the base is the total memory minus the memory reserved for the internal SYS500 tenant. After the data of a frozen MemStore is merged, the occupied memory can be released. Therefore, the memory occupied by the frozen MemStore is considered as memory available for the active MemStore, and the memory that the blockcache can occupy is also considered as memory available to the MemStore.

  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>The value of <code>global_major_freeze_residual_memory</code> must be greater than the value of <code>global_write_halt_residual_memory</code>. Otherwise, the global freeze trigger will not take effect, and a global freeze can be triggered only by tenants.   </p>
