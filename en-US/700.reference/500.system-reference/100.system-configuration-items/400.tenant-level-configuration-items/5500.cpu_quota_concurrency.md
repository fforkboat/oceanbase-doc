cpu_quota_concurrency
==========================================

cpu_quota_concurrency specifies the maximum concurrency allowed for each CPU quota of a tenant.


| **Property** | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------|
| Type | Double-precision floating-point number |
| Default value | 4 |
| Value range | \[1, 10\] |
| Effective upon an OBServer restart | No |



The number of threads that can be concurrently handled by a tenant is controlled by two parameters: cpu_quota_concurrency and workers_per_cpu_quota. The two parameters must meet the following condition:

`workers_per_cpu_quota > cpu_quota_concurrency`

* `workers_per_cpu_quota` specifies the maximum number of worker threads that a tenant can allocate to each CPU.

   For more information about workers_per_cpu_quota, see [workers_per_cpu_quota](../300.cluster-level-configuration-items/16300.px_workers_per_cpu_quota.md).


* `cpu_quota_concurrency` specifies the number of active worker threads of the tenant on each CPU, that is, the number of concurrent worker threads.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>When the physical machine has sufficient CPU resources, you can set<code>cpu_quota_concurrency</code> to a large value. If the physical machine has insufficient CPU resources, you can set <code>cpu_quota_concurrency</code> to a small value to avoid risks. </p>
