# cpu_quota_concurrency


`cpu_quota_concurrency` specifies the maximum concurrency allowed for each CPU quota of a tenant.


| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------|
| Type | Double-precision floating-point number |
| Default value | 4 |
| Value range | \[1, 10\] |
| Effective upon restart of OBServer node | No |


The number of threads that can be concurrently handled by a tenant is controlled by two parameters: `cpu_quota_concurrency` and `workers_per_cpu_quota`. The two parameters must meet the following condition:

`workers_per_cpu_quota > cpu_quota_concurrency`

* `workers_per_cpu_quota` specifies the maximum number of worker threads that a tenant can allocate to each CPU.

   For more information about workers_per_cpu_quota, see [workers_per_cpu_quota](../300.cluster-level-configuration-items/23200.workers_per_cpu_quota.md).


* `cpu_quota_concurrency` specifies the number of active worker threads of the tenant on each CPU, that is, the number of concurrent worker threads.

  <p> We recommend that you do not modify this parameter to avoid potential risks. That is, a smaller value may impact performance and even pose stability risks, while a larger value might result in increased memory usage and potential high CPU load. </p>
