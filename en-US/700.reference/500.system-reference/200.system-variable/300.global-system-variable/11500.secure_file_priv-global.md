Here is an example of connecting to OceanBase Database through a local Unix Socket:

```sql
obclient -S /home/admin/oceanbase/run/sql.sock -u******@obtenant
```

The parameters are described as follows:

* -S: Specifies the Unix Socket file path for the local OBServer node. This file is located under the installation directory at `run/sql.sock`. The default Unix Socket file path is `/home/admin/oceanbase/run/sql.sock`.
* -u: Specifies the connection account for the tenant in the format of username@tenant name.
* When connecting through Unix Socket, you can only connect to the local OBServer node. Additionally, make sure that the resources for this tenant are distributed on the local OBServer node. If the resources for this tenant are not distributed on the local OBServer node, you are not able to connect to this tenant through the local OBServer node.
