# secure_file_priv

`secure_file_priv` specifies the path in which file import and export can be performed. This variable can be specified only by the database administrator (DBA).

| **Property** | **Description** |
|-----------|---------|
| Type | Varchar |
| Default value | NULL |
| Valid values | <li>An empty string: No limit is posed and any path can be accessed.<li>A path name: Only files in the specified path can be imported or exported.<li> `NULL`: File import and export are disabled. |
| Applicable scope | Global |
| Plan generation affected | Yes |

You can use this variable to modify the directory where the secure file resides and set the directory to an empty string. Sample code:

```sql
obclient> SET GLOBAL secure_file_priv = "";
```

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>For security reasons, you can execute the SQL statement that modifies the global variable only by using an OBClient whose server has the same IP address as that of the server where the connected OBServer node is located. </p>
  </main>
