# GV$OB_LOG_STAT

## Feature

This view displays the Palf status of the log stream. You can use this view to:

1. Query whether a log stream has a leader. 
2. Query the member list, that is, the number of Paxos replicas, of a log stream. 
3. Query the replica synchronization status. 
4. Query the recyclable checkpoint of the logs of a log stream. 
5. Query the log consumption service scope of a log stream based on the log sequence number (LSN) or system change number (SCN). 
6. Query the access mode of Palf. 

The query results vary with the tenant.

- When you query this view from a sys tenant, the Palf status of all tenant log streams is displayed. 
- When you query this view from a user tenant, only the Palf status of the log streams of the current tenant is displayed.
