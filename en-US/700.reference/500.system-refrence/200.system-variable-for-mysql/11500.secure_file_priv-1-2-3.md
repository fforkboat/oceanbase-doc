You can use this variable to modify the directory where the secure file resides and set the directory to an empty string. Example:

```sql
obclient> SET GLOBAL secure_file_priv = "";
```

> For security reasons, you can execute the SQL statement that modifies the global variable only by using an OBClient whose server has the same IP address as that of the server where the connected OBServer node is located.
