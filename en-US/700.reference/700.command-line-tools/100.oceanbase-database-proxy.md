# OceanBase Database Proxy

OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), also known as obproxy, is a dedicated proxy server for OceanBase Database. Each OBServer node stores the data of OceanBase Database users with multiple replicas, while ODP receives SQL requests from users. ODP forwards SQL requests to the optimal target OBServer node, and returns the execution result to users.


## Features

As a key component of OceanBase Database, ODP has the following features:

* Connection Management

   For the physical connections of a client, ODP maintains its connections to multiple OBServer nodes at the backend. It also adopts the incremental data synchronization solution based on version numbers to maintain the session status of each OBServer node connection. This ensures efficient client access to each OBServer node.

* Optimal routing

   ODP fully considers the location of the replica involved in the user request, read/write split routing policy configured by the user, optimal procedure for multi-region deployment of OceanBase, and the status and load of each OceanBase server. It routes the user requests to the optimal OBServer node and ensures the high-performance operation of OceanBase.

* High-performance forwarding

   ODP is fully compatible with the MySQL protocol and supports the proprietary protocol of OceanBase. It adopts the multi-threaded asynchronous framework and transparent streaming forwarding to ensure high-performance data forwarding. In addition, it consumes minimal cluster resources.

* Easy O&M

   ODP is stateless and supports unlimited horizontal scale-out. It allows you to access multiple OceanBase clusters at the same time. You can perform real-time monitoring of ODP status by using various internal commands, which greatly facilitates O&M.

* High availability

   On the one hand, ODP itself is highly available to provide continuous proxy service. On the other hand, ODP is a key component of the OceanBase high availability mechanism, which protects users from interruptions such as downtime and upgrades, and ensures the stability and fast recovery of OceanBase Database services.

* Proprietary protocol

   By default, ODP and OBServer nodes use the proprietary protocol of OceanBase Database. For example, ODP performs cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) on messages to ensure the correctness of OBServer node connections. ODP also enhances the transmission protocol to support Oracle-compatible data types and interaction models.
