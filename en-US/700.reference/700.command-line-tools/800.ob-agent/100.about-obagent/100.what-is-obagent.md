# What is OBAgent

This topic describes OBAgent and its features.

OBAgent is a data monitoring and collection framework. OBAgent supports both data pushing and pulling for different scenarios. By default, OBAgent supports plug-ins for server data collection, OceanBase Database metrics collection, monitoring data label processing, and HTTP services of the Prometheus protocol. To enable data collection from other sources or customize the data processing flow, you only need to develop the corresponding plug-ins.

## Features

OBAgent has the following features:

* Developed in the Go language, without the necessity for external dependencies
* Plug-in driven, which makes it easy to develop
