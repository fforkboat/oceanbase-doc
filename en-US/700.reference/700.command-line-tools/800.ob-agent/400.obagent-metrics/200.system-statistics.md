# System statistics

This topic describes the general statistical events.

You can use an SQL statement to display all statistical events and their types in alphabetical order in the sys tenant. Example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT name,class FROM v$statname ORDER BY name;
```

The general statistical events are constantly updated. <!-- For the latest version of general statistical events, see [General statistical events](../../../../7.reference/3.system-views/2.statistical-event-description.md). -->
