clog_tool 
==============================



The Clog logs in OceanBase Database are similar to the REDO logs in a traditional database. They persist the transaction data when a transaction is committed. The transaction data is the record of transaction modifications to the database. You can run the clog_tool commands to parse and print clog files. The clog_tool feature is integrated in the ob_admin tool. You can run the `ob_admin` command to call clog_tool. 

clog_tool commands 
---------------------------------------

The following table describes frequently used clog_tool commands. 


|    Command    |                                                 Description                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dump_all`    | Parses and prints the specified clog file.                                                                   |
| `dump_hex`    | Parses and prints the specified clog file, and converts non-printing characters into hexadecimal characters. |
| `dump_format` | Parses the specified clog file and prints the file in a format that is similar to an SQL statement.          |
| `dump_filter` | Parses the specified clog file and prints the log records that meet the specified conditions.                |
| `stat_clog`   | Parses the specified clog file and prints the statistics of the file.                                        |



### The dump_all command

```unknow
ob_admin clog_tool dump_all <clog_file_name>
```



Notes:

* You can run the `dump_all` command to parse and print the specified clog file. When you need to parse multiple files, separate the file names with spaces.

  




<!-- -->

* You need to replace the `clog_file_name` string with the actual file name. The path of the file can be included in the file name. For example:

  * If you want to parse and print a single clog file, the file name is `101`, and the file is in the current directory, you can run the following command: 

    ```unknow
    ob_admin clog_tool dump_all 101
    ```

    
  

  
  <!-- -->

  * If you want to parse and print multiple clog files, the file names are `101` and `103`, and both files are in the current directory, you can run the following command: 

    ```unknow
    ob_admin clog_tool dump_all 101 103
    ```

    
  

  
  <!-- -->

  * If you want to parse and print multiple clog files whose file names sequentially ascend, such as `101`, `102` `103`, and`104`, and the files are all in the current directory, you can run the following command: 

    ```unknow
    ob_admin clog_tool dump_all {101..104}
    ```

    
  

  




### The dump_hex command 

```unknow
ob_admin clog_tool dump_hex <clog_file_name>
```



Notes:

* If a clog log contains non-printing characters, the ob_admin tool cannot print these characters by running the `dump_all` command. You can run the `dump_hex` command to convert non-printing characters into hexadecimal characters and print them.

  




<!-- -->

* For more information about `<clog_file_name>`, see [The dump_all command](#the-dump_all-command).

  




### The dump_format command 

```unknow
ob_admin clog_tool dump_format <clog_file_name>
```



Notes:

* Logs printed by the `dump_all` command are not friendly to readers. You can run the `dump_format` command to parse the specified clog file and print it in a format that is similar with SQL statements.

  




<!-- -->

* For more information about `<clog_file_name>`, see [The dump_all command](#the-dump_all-command).

  




### The dump_filter command 

```unknow
ob_admin clog_tool dump_filter '<filter_name>' <clog_file_name>
```



Notes:

* You can run the `dump_filter` command to filter unwanted records in a clog file.

  




<!-- -->

* For more information about `<clog_file_name>`, see [The dump_all command](#the-dump_all-command).

  

* You can filter log records by specifying the filter conditions in the `filter_name` field. The following two types of condition are supported:

  

  | Filter condition |                      Description                       |
  |------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
  | `table_id`       | Specifies the ID of the table to be filtered.          |
  | `partition_id`   | Specifies the ID of the data partition to be filtered. |

  

  You can use only one or both types of filter conditions. When you set multiple filter conditions, separate the conditions with semicolons (;). For example:
  * If you want to parse and print the clog file `101` which is in the current directory, and filter out records of the table 123 in the clog file, run the following command: 

    ```unknow
    ob_admin clog_tool dump_filter 'table_id=123' 101
    ```

    
  

  
  <!-- -->

  * If you want to parse and print the clog file `101` which is in the current directory, and filter out records of the table `123` and partition `2` in the clog file, run the following command: 

    ```unknow
    ob_admin clog_tool dump_filter 'table_id=123;partition_id=2' 101
    ```

    
  

  




### The stat_clog command 

```unknow
ob_admin clog_tool stat_clog <clog_file_name>
```



You can run the `stat_clog` command to obtain statistics of the specified clog file, including the file size, number of records, and number of transactions.
