Install and deploy oblogproxy by using the installation package 
====================================================================================

You can install and deploy oblogproxy by using the source code or downloading the installation package. This topic describes how to install and deploy oblogproxy by downloading the installation package. 

oblogproxy is a proxy service for managing incremental logs of OceanBase Database. It is a part of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS). Designed based on liboblog, oblogproxy provides links for applications to access and manage real-time incremental data logs of OceanBase Database. 

oblogproxy allows you to subscribe to incremental logs in isolated networks and supports multiple access methods. You can perform the following steps to configure and use oblogproxy. 

Configure the YUM repository of OceanBase Database 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

```unknow
yum install -y yum-utils
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/OceanBase.repo
```



Download the precompiled package 
-----------------------------------------------------

Go to the [download page](https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/community/stable/el/7/x86_64/) and download the precompiled package named "oblogproxy-xxxx.OS version.x86_64.rpm". You need to select the package based on the version of your operating system and run the following command to install the package:

```unknow
yum install -y oblogproxy-xxxx.OS version.x86_64.rpm
```



oblogproxy will be installed in the `/usr/local/oblogproxy` directory.

Configure the sys tenant 
---------------------------------------------

After you obtain the account and password of the sys tenant of your OBServer, you need to encrypt them and configure them for oblogproxy. Run the following command to obtain the encrypted strings of the account and password:

```unknow
# Assume that the account and password are user and pswd.
./logproxy -x user
# After you run the command, you will get the following string: 4B9C75F64934174F4E77EE0E9A58****
./logproxy -x pswd
# After you run the command, you will get the following string: DCE2AF09D006D6A440816880B938****
```



Copy the encrypted account and password strings to the `ob_sys_username` and `ob_sys_password` fields of the conf.json file in the `/usr/local/oblogproxy/conf/` directory. For example:

```unknow
{
  "ob_sys_username": "4B9C75F64934174F4E77EE0E9A58****",
  "ob_sys_password": "DCE2AF09D006D6A440816880B938****"
}
```



Run oblogproxy 
-----------------------------------

```unknow
cd /usr/local/oblogproxy
bash ./run.sh start
```



Use oblogclient for data subscription 
----------------------------------------------------------

You can use oblogclient to subscribe to data from OceanBase Database. Make sure that you have installed [Maven](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.oceanbase.logclient) dependencies before use. 

```java
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.oceanbase.logclient</groupId>
  <artifactId>logproxy-client</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```



After that, you can configure oblogclient by referencing to the following sample code:

```java
ObReaderConfig config = new ObReaderConfig();
// Specify the IP addresses of OceanBase root servers and separate multiple IP addresses with semicolons (;) in the following format: ip1:rpc_port1:sql_port1;ip2:rpc_port2:sql_port2
config.setRsList("127.0.0.1:2882:2881;127.0.0.2:2882:2881");
// Specify the username and password (user tenant).
config.setUsername("root");
config.setPassword("root");
// Specify the UNIX start timestamp in seconds. A value of 0 specifies to start the client from the current time. 
config.setStartTimestamp(0L);
// Specify the subscription whitelist in the tenant.db.table format. Use asterisks (*) as wildcards.
config.setTableWhiteList("sys.*.*");

// Specify the IP address of the server where oblogproxy is deployed to create the client instance.
LogProxyClient client = new LogProxyClient("127.0.0.1", 2983, config);
// Add the RecordListener
client.addListener(new RecordListener() {
    @Override
    public void notify(LogMessage message){
        // Process the message.
    }

    @Override
    public void onException(LogProxyClientException e) {
        // Handle the error.
        if (e.needStop()) {
            // Stop the client when an unrecoverable exception occurs.
            client.stop();
        }
    }
});

// Start the client
client.start();
client.join();
```

Notes 
--------------------------

* You do not need to specify the information of OceanBase clusters when you configure oblogproxy. Technically, oblogproxy can subscribe to multiple OceanBase clusters when it is connected to all OBServers and can log on to the clusters by using the specified account and password of the sys tenant. For security, we recommend that you do not expose the account and password to oblogclient users.

  

* oblogproxy is stateless. It obtains the information of databases and tables for data subscription from oblogclient. The information such as the timestamps of incremental logs is also stored by oblogclient. When oblogproxy resumes the connection to an OBServer after disconnection, it is equivalent to creating a new connection.

  

* oblogproxy consumes a large amount of memory. We recommend that you deploy oblogproxy and OBServers on different servers.
